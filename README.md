Klingonska Akademien
====================
[Klingonska Akademien][main] is a large reference site for the Klingon
language. It contains an extensive [dictionary][dict] (with both English and
Swedish translations), the [Archive of Okrandian Canon][canon], a [word
extraction and learning tool][glossary], and lots of articles about various
other stuff, such as [the Klingon alphabet][piqad], [songs in Klingon][songs]
etc.


Changes
-------
**May 2025:** Page suddenly went offline on May 1, due to troubles with our
hosting solution. It should now be up and running again (May 8). This time with
HTTPS, and a few, older, server-side scripts will stop working until we
reimplement using more modern means. (This means that the [Pocket
dictionary][dict] and the [Archive of Okrandian Canon][canon] search functions
unfortunately will remain offline for now.)

**November 2013:** Adding new words from the dictionary! Trying to catch up
with the backlog of words to added to the language in 2012 and 2013. There is
[a Google document][gdoc] for words which will be added, which we're currently
working our way through it. (You can add stuff to it yourself, if you feel that
some word is missing.)

**March 3, 2013:** Finished [Klingon Glossary Extractor & Flashcards][glossary]
– a combined language analyzer and flashcard program for learning the words of
any text in Klingon. The tool keeps track of what you've learned so far, and
lets you practice the words unknown to you. Feedback is greatly appreciated
(use [email][webmaster], or [GitHub Issue Tracking][issue]).

**September 7, 2012:** Rolling out the new design is taking its time, but as of
now most pages have the new look (except for some old, rarely used ones, and
pages served by CGI). Work will continue, but for now we'll concentrate on more
interesting stuff. There also was a major re-write of [**pIqaD**, And How to
Read It][piqad], with improved pronunciation info, info on dialects etc.

**July 1, 2012:** We're currently rolling out a major site re-design. This
means adding a new look to the pages, as well as changing into a fully
automated build system. As we, slowly, painstakingly, convert all pages into
the new format, you'll see the new red page header take over, until it is
*everywhere*. – Don't worry, we are not about to remove any content.

[preface] Preface
-----------------
<p class=canon>Throughout this document a text on a green background is used to
mark a quote from Okrandian Canon…</p>

<p class=noncanon>…while a red background is used to indicate that the text is
a quote from some other material.</p>

<p class=noindent>This is the beginning of an investigation into the Klingon
alphabet and its typographical and phonological nuances. Since there does not
really exist any <i>canon</i> Klingon alphabet (Okrand speaks about {pIqaD} but
he never makes use of it.) I have adopted the KLI approved alphabet, used by
most klingonists. Paramount themselves use a typeface constructed by
the <i>Astra Image Corporation</i> which contains only ten glyphs, but since
this is the Klingon alphabet we see in the movies and in <i>Star Trek: The Next
Generation</i>, I intend to do a comparison between the two, and hopefully be
able to create a typeface which looks more like the {pIqaD} we see on the
silver screen.</p>

I also intend to do a survey of the different styles of usage of {pIqaD} among
klingonists (mainly on the Internet, but other contributions are also welcome
if you have any) to see how much one can actually play around with the glyphs
and still be able read them.

<p class=noindent>There are also <a href="../writing/examples/#nicholas">some
images created by Nick Nicholas</a> (one of the people behind the restored
version of the Klingon {Hamlet}) that are quite interesting, as they show what
seem to be {pIqaD} written with a ballpoint pen, a calligraphy pen (in a
Fraktur hand – perhaps used in the first printed books on Kronos?), and with a
brush. (These images were originally found on KLI’s FTP area in February 2000,
but that FTP seems to have gone defunct in intervening years.)</p>

Worth mentioning is also the article “Writing Klingon: The Easy Way” by Theron
P. Elliot, (published in {HolQeD} 2:2 pp.10--11) in which he uses a triangular
grid as a basis for writing {pIqaD}. It is interesting mostly because is also
shows the direction of the pen while writing, but otherwise I do not think that
the grid makes the Klingon glyphs justice.

<i>Interstellar Language School</i> (lead by Glen F. Proechel) has published
“An Alien Writing System Primer” explaining how to write {pIqaD} in longhand.
(It is non-canon, of course -- and to my knowledge not endorsed by the KLI.)

<p class=noindent>Many thanks to Nick Nicholas for his constructive criticism
and helpful suggestions.</p>


[alphabet] The Klingon Alphabet ({pIqaD})
-----------------------------------------
<div class=noncanon>
  <p>More recently we’ve been treated to a different alphabet, (often
    incorrectly attributed to Michael Okuda, scenic designer for <i>TNG</i>),
    one which corresponds to the phonemes of Klingon as described by Okrand
    in <i>TKD</i>. While the characters themselves are easily identifiable
    from background displays on <i>TNG</i> (assuming one has access to video
    equipment and a reasonably large television screen), there has never been
    an “official” release describing the particular relationship between
    individual glyphs and specific sounds. As Okuda has indicated […] all
    Klingon background displays are composed for appearance, not communication.
    And yet, an unofficial letter to a Klingon fan group from an unnamed source
    at Paramount resulted in the following alphabet:</p>

  </table>
  <p class=indent>Unlike its predecessor, these glyphs provide an excellent fit
    to the phonology of Klingon, or more specifically that of {tlhIngan Hol}.
    However, other questions still remain.</p>
  <p>The keen observer of <i>ST6</i> will note several Klingon glyphs which are
    not included in the alphabet above. While some appear to be simple
    rotations of characters (and one is reminded of Sequoyah’s creation of the
    Cherokee syllabary), other appear to be completely novel. That they are not
    included in the alphabet need not necessarily be cause for distress, nor
    tempt us to suspect the assignment of sound to sign. Our own writing system
    is replete with logographs, single characters representing whole ideas or
    words (e.g., !, @, #, $, %), clearly a part of the system but not a part of
    the alphabet.</p>
  <p>Then too, it may be helpful to keep in mind Allan Wechsler’s remarks […]
    on the sparse distribution of consonants in {tlhIngan Hol}. While perhaps a
    bit far fetched, the unexplained characters might be instances of
    alphabetic characters from an earlier, and phonemically larger, form of the
    language, maintained either for historical purposes in affairs of state (I
    refer here to the trial scene in <i>ST6</i>), or more simply as
    decoration.</p>
  <p>In any case, there is clearly much much more to be learned about Klingon
    orthography, more tantalizing promises and secrets to be discovered. Of
    course it’s unknown whether any further explanations are apt to be
    forthcoming, but at least the exotica is there. Or, to make the case more
    clear by example, what precisely is “the Klingon mummification glyph,” and
    what is its role in a larger writing
    system? <small>[<a href="../canon/1992-03-holqed-01-1-b.txt">{HolQeD} 1:1

There also exist a “canon” set of Klingon punctuation marks, used on the SkyBox
trading cards in their “{pIqaD}” text. Though the use is somewhat inconsistent
on these cards I would like to concur with Nick Nicholas interpretation that
the upturned triangle function as a full stop (period) and the downturned
triangle as a comma / semicolon. These are also the only punctuation marks that
the Klingon language really requires, since both questions and imperatives are
clearly marked grammatically.

### Doubled Consonants ###

Though frowned upon by older Klingons it is not all that uncommon that doubled
consonants are pronounced as only one letter by younger Klingons. The word
{qettaH} <<He/she keeps on running,>> can be pronounced, either (1) with two
separately articulated {t}s in the middle, or (2) with one {t} held for an
extra moment to indicate the doubling, or finally (3) as if it was written with
just a single {t}. <small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<p class="canon hidden">[…] younger speakers tend to pronounce doubled
consonants as if they were single, while older speakers pretty much maintain
the distinction between single and doubled consonants. For example, in the word
{qettaH} (“He/she keeps on running”; {qet,} “run, jog,” plus {-taH,}
“continuous”), an older Klingon would either pronounce each {t} distinctly,
releasing the first one with a puff of air before articulating the second, or
else he or she would hold the {t} just a bit before releasing it, so that the
time taken up would be about the same as if each {t} were articulated
separately. A younger speaker, on the other hand, may pronounce the word as if
it were {qetaH}, though with the stress remaining on the first syllable as it
is in {qettaH}. Similarly, an older speaker would probably maintain the {mm} in
{bommey} (“songs”; {bom,} “song,” plus {-mey,} plural indicator) by either
pronouncing each {m} distinctly or, more likely in this case, prolonging the
{m}; some younger speakers (though a smaller number than in the case of {tt})
might say {bomey}, again with stress remaining on the first syllable. Only in
the case of {''} (as in {pa''a'} [“big room”]: {pa',} “room,” plus {-'a',} an
augmentative) is there a tendency in both groups to reduce the {''} to a single
{'}, though {''} (a somewhat prolonged gap between the preceding and following
{a}) is hardly unknown or archaic-sounding. The reduction of doubled consonants
to single follows a clear pattern. Those most likely to be reduced are {pp},
{tt}, [{qq}], and, as noted above, {''}; least likely to be reduced are {ll},
{mm}, {nn}, {ngng}, {vv}, {ww}, and {yy}. <small>[KGT p.138--139]</small></p>

{D}
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_retroflex_stop">ɖ</a>]
<i>Voiced retroflex stop</i> (called {Day} when spelling) -- In English, this
sound only occur in some dialects, such as in Indian English <i><u>d</u>ine</i>
[ɖaɪn] (<<to eat>>). The sound is similar to <i>d</i> in <i>dream</i>
or <i>android,</i> but the tip of the tongue touches the roof of the mouth
further back, at the back
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge">the alveolar ridge</a>
(this part of the alveolar ridge is covered with small ridges). As far as I
know, this sound does not occur in German.

The {D} sound exist in most Swedish central and northern dialects. This is how
the letters <i>rd</i> are pronounced when they occur together, e.g. in the
word <i lang=sv>no<u>rd</u></i> [nuːɖ] (meaning <<north>>). What is actually
going on here, phonetically, is that the <i>r</i> causes retroflexation of the
following consonant when it comes before

<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class=hidden>
  <p class=canon>{D} This sound is close to English <i>d</i> in <i>dream</i>
    or <i>android,</i> but it is not quite the same. The English <i>d</i> sound
    is made by touching the tip of the tongue to that part of the roof of the
    mouth just behind the upper teeth. Klingon {D} can best be approximated by
    English-speakers by touching the tip of the tongue to the roof of the mouth
    at a point about halfway between the teeth and the velum (or soft palate),
    that part of the roof of the mouth that is rather gooshy. As with Klingon
    {b}, some speakers pronounce {D} as if it were more like an <i>nd,</i> and
    a distinct minority as if it were {n}---but, of course, with the tongue in
    the same position as for {D}. <small>[TKD 1.1]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>The sound at the end of the first syllable of this word,
    {toD}, is {D}. To make this sound, point the tip of your tongue directly
    upwards, and touch the hard part of the roof of your mouth, and the do the
    same thing you would do to make a <i>d</i> sound. <small>[CK]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>For instance {Dal} means <<It is boring.>> To get the first

    towards the roof of your mouth. <small>[PK]</small></p>

{tlh}
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_affricate">t͡ɬ</a>]
<i>Voiceless alveolar lateral affricate</i> (called {tlhay} when
spelling) -- This sound does not occur in many Terran languages, but is common
in Nahuatl (the Aztec language). It even occurs in the name of the
language <i lang=nah>Náhua<u>tl</u></i> [ˈnaːwat͡ɬ].

One way to get the pronunciation right is to start off by saying <i>l</i>. As
you do it, pay attention to two things: (1) Your vocal cords are vibrating (if
you put your hand on your throat you can feel the vibrations quite clearly),
and (2) the tip of the tongue is firmly fixed to the roof of the mouth, with
the air passing by on both sides of the tongue.

Now, say <i>l</i> again, but this time without the humming of the vocal cords
(whisper!). You should no longer feel any vibrations in the hand on your
throat. (The sound you’re now pronouncing in written
[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_lateral_fricative">ɬ</a>]
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipa">IPA</a>.)

Now, say the sound yet again, but this time, <i>spit it out!</i> Build up a
little bit of pressure behind the tongue, then push out the air on both sides
of it. As before, there should be no humming from your vocal cords, and the tip
of the tongue should never leave the roof of your mouth. This is the Klingon
{tlh} sound.

Alternatively, you can think of it as pronouncing a <i>t</i> in a weird way:
Instead of lowering the <em>tip</em> of your tongue to let the air pass, keep
the tip of the tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, and lower
the <em>sides</em> of the tongue.
<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class=hidden>
  <p class=canon>{tlh} This sound does not occur in English, but is very much
    like the final sound in <i lang=nah>tetl,</i> the Aztec word for <<egg,>>
    if properly pronounced. To produce this sound, the tip of the tongue
    touches the same part of the roof of the mouth it touches for {t}, the
    sides of the tongue are lowered away from the side upper teeth, adn the air
    is forced through the space on both sides between tongue and teeth. The
    sound is produced with a great deal of friction, and the warning given in
    the description of Klingon {p} might be aptly repeated
    here. <small>[TKD 1.1]</small></p>

{'} [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_stop">ʔ</a>]
<i>Glottal stop</i> (called {qaghwI'} or just {'} when spelling) -- This sound
exist in spoken English but is not written -- it is the slight catch in the
throat between the two syllables of <i>uh-oh</i> or <i>unh-unh,</i> meaning
“no.” In some English dialects the letter <i>t</i> is pronounced this way
(e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney#Cockney_speech">Cockney</a> <i lang="en-uk-Cockney">bo<u>tt</u>le</i>
[ˈbɔʔo]). In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation">BBC
English</a> the letter <i>t</i> is pronounced this way before <i>n,</i> e.g.
in <i>bu<u>tt</u>on</i> [bʌʔn̩] (in speech with careful enunciation, however, a
proper <i>t</i> sound is often heard instead).

The Swedish term for this sound
is <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottal_klusil"><i lang=sv>glottal
klusil</i></a> (or <i lang=sv>laryngal klusil</i>) and the sound is, as in
English, commonly used, but not written. It is cessation of sound in the middle
of <i lang=sv>öh-oh</i> [œʔœ͜uː] (meaning <<oops!>>), or at end of some
pronunciations of the word <i lang=sv>meh</i> [meʔ] (used to express
indifference or boredom).

In German this sound is known
as <i lang=de><a href="http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Knacklaut">Knacklaut</a></i>
and it precedes any word or syllable that begins with a vowel. It has been
suggested to me that the difference in pronunciation
between <i lang=de>alkoholarmm</i> (meaning <<low in alcohol content>>)
and <i lang=de>alkoholarm</i> (made-up word, meaning <<warning about the
destructive effects of alcohol>>) would be the addition of a glottal stop in
the middle.

In Klingon, when {'} comes at the end of a word, the preceding sound is
abruptly cut off, and then repeated (after the glottal stop) in a soft whisper.
If you articulate the word {paw} (<<arrive>>) and {paw'} (<<collide>>) there
should be a clear and distinct sense of abrupt discontinuation in the latter.

<div class=hidden>
  <p class=canon>{'} The apostrophe indicates a sound which is frequently
    uttered, but not written, in English. It is a glottal stop, the slight
    catch in the throat between the two syllables of <i>uh-oh</i>
    or <i>unh-unh,</i> meaning “no.” When Klingon {'} comes at the end of a
    word, the vowel preceeding the {'} is often repeated in a very soft
    whisper, as if an echo. Thus, Klingon {je'} <<feed>> almost sound like
    {je'e}, where the articulation of the first {e} is abruptly cut off by the
    {'}, and the second {e} is an barely audible whisper. When {'} follows {w}
    or {y} at the end of a word, there is often a whispered, echoed {u} or {I}
    respectively. Occasionally the echo is quite audible, with a guttural sound
    like {gh} preceeding the echoed vowel. For example, {yIlI'} <<transmit
    it!>> can sound more like {yIlI'ghI}. This extra-heavy echo is heard most
    often when the speaker is particulary excited or
    angry. <small>[TKD 1.1]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>Did you hear the sounds cut off abruptly in the middle of the
    word? The correct pronounciation is {Qu'vatlh}, not {Quvatlh}. This abrupt
    cut-off is a very common feature of Klingon, you’ll hear it a
    lot. <small>[CK]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>{-na'} Notice how the sound stops abruptly at the end of this
    suffix, it’s {-na'}, not {-naaa}. <small>[PK]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>Many nonnative speakers of Klingon, especially those for whom
    Federation Standard is a first language, seem to have trouble with {'}, the
    glottal stop, at the end of a word. Articulated correctly, {'} is simply a
    very abrupt cessation of vocalization. The most common mispronunciation of
    {'} is as {q}, though some newer speakers leave {'} off altogether. Errors
    of this type could lead to confusion or confrontation. <small>[KGT

[stress] Stress
---------------

The instructions for stress given here are equivalent to those given
in <i>TKD,</i> (in that stress will wind up in the same places), however, here
they have been simplified quite a bit to ease look-up and memorization.

Stress is not normally indicated when writing Klingon, and the only piece of
Klingon canon where stress is shown is the pronunciation key of the sentences
in the TKD “cheat sheet” <small>[TKD pp. 171--172]</small>. In that
pronunciation respelling {HIjol} (<<Beam me aboard>>) is written “khi-JOL”.
<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class="canon hidden">
  <p>Each Klingon word of more than one syllable normally contains one stressed
    (or accented) syllable. The stressed syllable is pronounced at a slightly
    higher pitch and with a little more force than the nonstressed
    syllable(s).</p>
  <p>[…]</p>
  <p>Finally, it should be noted that there are some words which seem to have
    variable stress patterns, with the stress sometimes heard on one syllable
    and sometimes on another. This phenomenon is not yet understood. The rules
    given above do not account for this variability, but if they are followed,
    stress will wind up on acceptable syllables.</p>
  <p>In the system used to transcribe Klingon in this dictionary, stress is not
    indicated. <small>[TKD 1.3]</small></p>
</div>


### Verbs ###

Adjectival verbs are stressed as verbs.

<ul>
  <li><i>If a speaker emphasizes one or more suffixes,</i> then those suffixes
    are stressed, and all other syllables are unstressed. (Commonly emphasized
    suffixes are: {-'a'}, {-be'}, {-Qo'}, {-Ha'} and {-qu'}.)
  <li><i>Otherwise,</i> the last syllable of the stem is stressed, the first
    suffix is unstressed, and, after that, all suffixes ending in glottal stop
    are stressed.
</ul>

<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class=hidden>
  <p class=canon>In a verb, the stressed syllable is usually the verb itself,
    as opposed to any prefix or suffix. If, however, a suffix ending with {'}
    is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix, both the verb and
    the suffix ending in {'} are stressed. In addition, if the meaning of any
    particular suffix is to be emphasized, the stress may shift to that
    syllable. Suffixes indicating negation or emphasis (section 4.3) are
    frequently stressed, as is the interrogative suffix (section
    4.2.9). <small>[TKD 1.3]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>[…] A younger speaker, on the other hand, may pronounce the
    word [{qettaH}] as if it were {qetaH}, though with the stress remaining on
    the first syllable as it is in {qettaH}. <small>[KGT p. 138]</small></p>
  <p class=canon>Younger speakers also have a slight tendency to change the
    pronunciation of the vowel {a} in nonstressed syllables to something that
    sounds a bit like the <i>u</i> in Federation Standard <i>but</i>. If this
    sound is transcribed with the symbol {U}, a word like {qaleghpu'} (“I have
    seen you”) might sound more like {qUleghpu'}. <small>[KGT
    p. 139]</small></p>
  <div class=noncanon>
    <p>Verbs are likewise stressed on the final syllable of the stem: {Dál}
      <<to be boring>>, {ghIpDÍj} <<to court-martial>>. Unlike nouns, if the
      first suffix after the verb ends in a glottal stop, the suffix
      is <i>not</i> stressed. Thus the verb <<she has been an alien>> is
      {nóvpu'}, while the noun <<aliens>> in {novpú'}. If the suffix ending in
      a glottal stop is <i>other</i> than the first, then both it and the final
      syllable of the verb are stressed: {mughIpDÍjchoHDÍ'} <<when she started
      court-martialling me>>, {HóH'eghrupmó'} <<because he was ready to
      suicide>>.</p>
    <p>Semantically important suffixes can end up stressed instead of the verb
      stem. In practice in Klingon metre (which systematises this tendency)
      negative and interrogative suffixes are <i>always</i> stressed:
      {jIDalbé'} <<I am not boring>>, {bImatlhHá'} <<you are disloyal>>,
      {luDelQó'} <<they refuse to describe it>>, {chol'á'} <<is he coming?>>
      Note that adjectival verbs are considered verbs: {'útlh mátlhqu'}
      <<a truly loyal officer>>. There are often cases where monosyllabic verbs
      and nouns are juxtaposed. In this text, adjectival verbs and subject
      nouns tend to be stressed more strongly, following an iambic pattern.
      Thus {'utlh mátlh} <<a loyal officer>>, {matlh 'útlh} <<the officer is
      loyal>>. <small>[{Hamlet} (pocket edition), Appendix II,
      pp. 215--216]</small></p>
  </div>
</div>


### Nouns ###


Nominalized verbs (nouns created using suffixes {-wI’} and {-ghach}) are
stressed as nouns.

<ul>
  <li><i>If there are syllables ending in glottal stop,</i> those are stressed
    (and stressed equally).
  <li><i>Otherwise,</i> the last syllable of the stem is stressed (in compound
    nouns, only the last syllable of the <i>last stem</i> is stressed).
</ul>

<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class=hidden>
  <p class=canon>In a noun, the stressed syllable is usually the syllable right
    before the first noun suffix, or the final syllable if there is no suffix.
    If, however, a syllable ending in {'} is present, it is usually stressed
    instead. If there are two syllables in a row {'} both ending in {'}, both
    are equally stressed. <small>[TKD 1.3]</small></p>
  <div class=noncanon>
    <p class=noindent>Nouns are stressed on the final syllable of the stem:
      {ghóp} <<hand>>, {puyjáq} <<nova>>, {bortáS} <<revenge>>. Any suffixes
      added on to the stem are not stressed: {puyjáqvam} <<this nova>>,
      {bortáSmey} <<revenges>>.</p>
    <p>However, if any syllable in a noun, whether in the stem or in a suffix,
      ends in a glottal stop, it is stressed instead of the stem’s final
      syllable. Thus: {bó'DIj} <<court>>, {ghopDú'} <<hands>>, {puyjaqvó'}
      <<from the nova>>. Adjacent syllables ending in glottal stops receive
      equal stress: {chú'wÍ'} <<trigger>>, although Klingon verse tends to
      stress the latter. Note that nouns derived from verbs are considered
      nouns: {vúm} <<to work>>, {vumwÍ'} <<worker>>, {vumtaHghách} <<working>>,
      {vumpú'ghach} <<a bout of work>>. <small>[{Hamlet} (pocket edition),
      Appendix II, pp. 215--216]</small></p>
  </div>
</div>


### The Rest ###

Everything we know about stress in {chuvmey} comes from the few examples of
exclamations that occur in the TKD “cheat sheet”, and all of these have their
final syllable stressed.

<ul>
  <li>Final syllable is stressed.
</ul>

    <p>Klingon originally had a ternary number system; that is, one based on
      three. Counting proceeded as follows: 1, 2, 3; 3+1, 3+2, 3+3; 2×3+1,
      2×3+2, 2×3+3; 3×3+1, 3×3+2, 3×3+3; and the it got complicated. In
      accordance with the more accepted practice, the Klingon Empire sometime
      back adopted a decimal number system, one based on ten.</p>
    <p>Though no one knows for sure, it is likely that this change was made
      more out of concern for understanding the scientific data of other
      civilizations than out of a spirit of cooperation. <small>[TKD
      pp. 52--53]</small></p>
  </div>
  <p class=canon>Older Klingon music was based on a nonatonic scale---that is,
    one made up of nine tones. Each tone has a specific name, comparable to the
    “do, re, mi” system used in describing music on Earth. The nine tone names
    are (the first and ninth, as with Earth’s “do,” being the same): {yu},
    {bIm}, {'egh}, {loS}, {vagh}, {jav}, {Soch}, {chorgh}, {yu}. While the
    first three (and ninth) of these words apparently are used only for singing
    the scale, the remaining five are also numerals: {loS}, “four”; {vagh},
    “five”; {jav}, “six”; {Soch}, “seven”; {chorgh}, “eight.” It is possible
    that, at some time in the past, the numerals were “borrowed” into the
    lexicon of music in order to sing the scale but, for some reason, the first
    three (presumably {wa'}, {cha'}, {wej} [“one, two, three”]) were either
    changed or never used. It is far more likely, however, that the borrowing
    went in the other direction. As is well documented, the Klingon counting
    system was originally a ternary system (one based on three, with numbers
    higher than three formed from the words for “one,” “two,” and “three”).
    Later, owing to outside influences, it changed to a decimal system (based
    on ten). The independent words for the numbers three through nine were not
    originally a part of the Klingon counting system, but they had to come from
    somewhere. The musical scale is the likely source. The word for the fourth
    musical tone, {loS}, began to be used for the number four, and so on
    through the eighth tone, {chorgh}. (The origins of the words {Hut} [“nine”]
    and the suffix {-maH}, used in the words for “ten,” “twenty,” “thirty,” and
    so on, are obscure.) <small>[KGT pp. 72--73]</small></p>

[dialects] Dialects
-------------------

We have known that there are more than one Klingon dialect ever since TKD
(which hinted at this in the description of the sounds {b}, {n} and {m} in “The
Sounds of Klingon”) but most of the information we have today we got with KGT
(which described the below listed dialects, as well as some other variations in
speech related to the speaker’s age, and social class).
<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class=hidden>
  <div class=canon>
    <p>{b} As in English <i>bronchitis</i> or <i>gazebo.</i> Some Klingons
      pronounce this sound as if it were {m} and {b} articulated almost
      simultaneously. Speakers of English can approximate this sound by
      saying <i>imbalance</i> without the initial <i>i</i> sound. A very small
      number of Klingons pronounce {b} as if it were {m.}</p>
    <p>[…]</p>
    <p>{n} As in English <i>nectarine</i> or <i>sunspot.</i> Those Klingons who
      pronounce {D} more like {n} can easily articulate and hear the two sounds
      differently. Even a {D} that sounds like {n} is pronounced with the
      tongue in the Klingon {D} position, not in the English <i>d</i> position.
      Klingon {n} is produced with the tongue in same position as
      English <i>d.</i></p>
    <p>{m} As in English <i>mud</i> or <i>pneumatic.</i> Those few Klingons who
      pronounce {b} as {m} would say Klingon {baH} <i>fire</i> (<i>a
      torpedo</i>) and {maH} <i>we</i> the same way, and have to memorize which
      word is spelled which way. <small>[TKD 1.1]</small></p>
  </div>
</div>


### [takev] The Tak’ev Dialect ###

Dialect spoken in the Tak’ev ({taq'ev}) region. It is one of the larger
minority dialects and has a much greater number of speakers that the Krotmag
dialect. It sounds like blend of Krotmag an Standard Klingon, and is the one
dialect (that we know of) which most closely resembles Standard Klingon. It is
only briefly described in canon.

<ul>
  <li>Nasal vowels
  <li>Pronounces {b} as {mb}
  <li>Pronounces {D} as {ND}
</ul>

<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<p class="canon hidden">Speaking in a manner that is sort of between that of
  the Krotmag region and {ta' Hol} are the peoples of Tak’ev ({taq'ev}), who,
  though still a minority population, greatly outnumber the residents of
  Krotmag. These people maintain the distinction between {b} and {m} but
  pronounce the {b} as if it were {mb}; that is, starting off as the {m} sound
  but ending up at a {b}. Similarly, {D} is pronounced more like {nD} (or, more
  accurately, {ND}). Thus {ba'} (“sit”) would be pronounced more like {mba'};
  {Hub} (“defend”) would sound like {Humb}; {Du'} (“farm”) would be {NDu'};
  {HoD} (“captain”) would be {HoND}; and {Dub} (“improve”) would be {NDumb}.
  The nasal vowel quality found in the Krotmag region is characteristic of
  Tak’ev speech as well. <small>[KGT p. 22]</small></p>


### [krotmag] The Krotmag Dialect ###

Dialect spoken in the Krotmag ({Qotmagh}) region. This dialect has fewer
speakers than the Tak’ev dialect, but is well known and easily recognized by
other Klingons. Some of the dialects peculiarities have even influenced
Standard Klingon.

<ul>
  <li>Nasal vowels
  <li>Pronounces {b} as {m} (as in English <i>mime</i>)
  <li>Pronounces {D} as {N}
  <li>Often uses extra words in noun phrases, originally to differentiate
    between words with {b} and {m} (e.g. {'uS qam} <i>leg foot,</i> {nach
    qam} <i>head face</i>), but now prevalent even when no disambiguation is
    needed (e.g. {NeS ghop} <i>arm hand,</i> {nach ghIch} <i>head nose,</i>
    {qorNu' tuq} <i>family house</i> and even {yan 'etlh} or {'etlh
    yan} <i>sword sword</i>)
  <li>Often adds short extra sentences to disambiguate between verbs with {b}
    and {m} (e.g. {mImoH. yIjotchoH.} <i>You’re impatient. Calm down!,</i>
    {mImoH. 'oy' mInNu'wIj.} <i>You’re ugly. My eyes ache.</i>)
</ul>

<small>[<a class=sources>Display Sources</a>]</small>

<div class=hidden>
  <div class=canon>
    <p>Those in the Krotmag ({Qotmagh}) region, for example, have
      characteristic ways of pronouncing the sounds {b} and {D}, as well as the
      vowels. In {ta' Hol}, {b} is pronounced the same as <i>b</i> in
      Federation Standard <i>bribe</i>. In the Krotmag dialect of Klingon,
      however, {b} and {m} are pronounced identically, both of them sounding
      like Federation Standard <i>m</i> as in <i>mime</i>. Thus, for example,
      the members of the following pairs of words sound exactly alike in the
      Krotmag dialect; however, they sound different in Standard Klingon:</p>
    <blockquote>
      {bup} (“quit”)/{mup} (“strike”)
      <br>{boH} (“be impatient”)/{moH} (“be ugly”)
      <br>{buS} (“concentrate on”)/{muS} (“hate”)
      <br>{ghob} (“wage war”)/{ghom} (“meet, encounter”)
      <br>{qab} (“face”)/{qam} (“foot”)
      <br>{Qub} (“think”)/{Qum} (“communicate”)
      <br>{teb} (“fill”)/{tem} (“deny”)
    </blockquote>
    <p>For the most part, this causes no problems for Krotmag dialect speakers.
      There are more homonyms (words that sound alike) in their dialect than in
      other dialects, but, as is the case with homonyms in general, context
      usually serves to clarify which word is meant. Occasionally, however, two
      identically pronounced words can be used in such similar contexts,
      raising the possibilities of at least ambiguity if not catastrophic
      misunderstanding, that some interesting speech patterns have developed.
      When there are nouns that sound alike, speakers are likely to use
      compound nouns (that is, use two nouns where otherwise one would do).
      This is probably most clearly seen with the pair of words meaning “face”
      and “foot,” both pronounced {qam} (though “face” is {qab} in Standard
      Klingon). Does {qamlIj vIghov} mean “I recognize your foot” or “I
      recognize your face”? Unless the course of the discussion clearly
      dictates which is meant (as it might, for example, in a conversation when
      buying shoes, though even here the possibility for ambiguity exists),
      there is no way to tell. In such a situation, “foot” would probably be
      rendered {'uS qam} (literally, “leg foot”); “face” would be {nach qam}
      (or, in the standard dialect, {nach qab}---literally, “head face”).
      Interestingly, though originally used only to avoid ambiguity with words
      containing {m} and {b}, these speech patterns have become quite common in
      the Krotmag region and are used even when {m} and {b} are not involved in
      the words at all. Thus, it would not be unusual to hear such utterances
      as {DeS ghop} (actually, {NeS ghop}---the meaning of {N} is explained
      below) meaning “arm hand” or {nach ghIch} (“head nose”), even though the
      single words {ghop} (“hand”) and {ghIch} (“nose”) need no disambiguation.
      Similarly, a house (lineage) is frequently called {qorDu' tuq} (actually,
      {qorNu' tuq})---literally, “family house”---rather than {tuq} (“house”)
      alone, and a sword is often termed {yan 'etlh} (or even {'etlh
      yan})---literally, “sword sword.” This manner of speaking is quite
      characteristic of this region.</p>
    <p>For verbs, a somewhat different tactic is employed. In {ta' Hol},
      there is no problem distinguishing {bIboH} (“You are impatient”) from
      {bImoH} (“You are ugly”). In the Krotmag region, however, both are
      pronounced {mImoH}. To make the speaker’s intent clear, it is not
      uncommon to add a short sentence immediately after the potentially
      ambiguous one:</p>
    <blockquote>
      {mImoH. yIjotchoH.}
      <br>[Standard: {bIboH. yIjotchoH.}]
      <br>(“You’re impatient. Calm down!”)
      <br>
      <br>{mImoH. 'oy' mInNu'wIj.}
      <br>[Standard: {bImoH. 'oy' mInDu'wIj.}]
      <br>(“You’re ugly. My eyes ache.”)
      <br>(See below regarding Krotmag {N}.)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Krotmag dialect speakers have a distinctive pronounciation of {D} as
      well: it sounds like {n}, except the tip of the tongue touches a point in
      the middle of the roof of the mouth rather than one behind the top teeth
      as it does for {n}. (For the sake of clarity in this discussion the way
      Krotmag dialect speakers pronounce {D} will be written {N}, to
      distingguish if from {n}.) The {D} sound in {ta' Hol} is also produced
      with the tongue pointing upward and not near the teeth (just like {N}),
      but otherwise the {D} sound is similar to that of Federation
      Standard <i>d</i> as in <i>did</i>. For speakers in the Krotmag region,
      the sounds {n} and {N} are distinct; the following pairs of words do not
      sound the same (the standard form of the second member of each pair
      follows in brackets):</p>
    <blockquote>
      {naH} (“fruit, vegetable”)/{NaH} (“now”) [{DaH}]
      <br>{nuj} (“mouth”)/{Nuj} (“vessel”) [{Duj}]
      <br>{mIn} (“eye”)/{mIN} (“colony”) [{mID}]
      <br>{nulegh} (“He/she sees us.”)/{Nulegh} (“He/she sees you.”) [{Dulegh}]
    </blockquote>
    <p>Though under most circumstances, speakers of the Krotmag dialect can
      easily distinguish between the two sounds, it is not unusual to hear a
      speaker add extra elements, as if to ensure clarity: {maH
      nulegh}---literally, “us, he/she sees us”; {SoH Nulegh}---literally,
      “you, he/she sees you.” This does not happen anywhere nearly as
      frequently as it does with words with {b} or {m}, however. Speakers of
      other forms of Klingon, on the other hand, find the Krotmag
      pronunciations of {N} and {n} to be so similar as to be
      indistinguishable. When trying to speak in the Krotmag manner, they tend
      to pronounce all words with {D} as if they used {n} instead, rather than
      {N}, making it possible for a true Krotmag speaker to differentiate a
      fellow resident from an outsider, but also making communication
      difficult. Misunderstandings, sometimes with unfortunate consequences,
      are not all that uncommon.</p>
    <p>A third characteristic of the Krotmag accent is the nasal quality of the
      vowels, caused by the air being expelled through the mouth and nose at
      the same time while speaking. This in no way impedes communication with
      speakers of other dialects, but it does give the dialect a distinct
      tone.</p>
    <p>Although the number of speakers of the dialect of the Krotmag region is
      relatively small, their speech patterns are well known and easily
      recognized and have actually had an effect on other dialects. It is not
      uncommon for speakers of one dialect to imitate the speech of another,
      whether as a way to mock the speakers of a nonstandard dialect or as a
      way to learn about that dialect to be prepared for a change in
      leadership. A bit of dialect mixture results, with words or
      pronunciations of one dialect being added to another. The distinctive
      pronunciations of the Krotmag dialect are surely responsible for some
      slang and idiomatic usages in Klingon in general. For example, {chab
      chu'} (literally, “new pie”) is another way to say “new invention” or
      “latest innovation.” This is no doubt because the Krotmag pronunciation
      of {chab} (“pie”) is {cham}, the same as the word for “technology.”
      Similarly, a slang word for “sword” is {yaD} (literally, “toe”), based on
      the Krotmag pronunciation of {yaD} as {yaN}, which to most Klingons will
      sound like {yan} (“sword”). <small>[KGT pp. 18--22]</small></p>

### The Morskan Dialect ###

Dialect spoken on the conquered Klingon world Morska. We’re treated to brief
bout of the Morskan dialect of Klingon in *ST6* when Enterprise encounters a
Klingon listening post. (The Klingon spelling of the word “Morska” is
unknown -- the only canon occurrence is in spoken form, in the Morskan dialect,
by that guard in *ST6*).

The Morskan dialect is characterized by the following speech patterns.

<ul>
  <li>Pronounces {tlh} as {ghl} at the beginning of syllables, and as {ts} (as
    in English <i>cats</i>) at the end
  <li>Pronounces {H} as {h} (as in English <i>hat</i>) at beginning of
    syllables, and not pronounced at all at end
  <li>Pronounces {Q} as Standard Klingon {H}
  <li>Usually drops {-'e'} from the final noun in “to be” phrases (except when
    the subject of such phrases are emphasised)
</ul>

<div class=hidden>
  <p class=canon>In addition to the regions on Kronos (and there are more than
    those mentioned above), of course, are the various planets that have become
    part of the Empire. On some, such as Morska, a dialect of Klingon has all
    but replaced any languages originally spoken; on others, such as Vaq’aj II,
    native languages survive alongside {ta' Hol}. Interestingly, the dialects
    of Klingon spoken on conquered planets are not as different from {ta' Hol}
    as are some of the dialects on Kronos itself. That is because the Klingon
    language came to the conquered planets relatively recently and therefore
    remains somewhat similar to that spoken by the conquerors, while the
    dialects on Kronos have been spoken for a much longer period and have had
    time to develop differently. <small>[KGT p. 18]</small></p>

  <div class=canon>
    <p>The speech of residents of the planet Morska has some identifiable
      phonological characteristics also. Most striking is the absence of the
      sound {tlh.} Syllables ending with {tlh} in most dialects end with {ts}
      (pronounced the same as <i>ts</i> in Federation Standard <i>cats</i>) in
      the Morskan dialect; at the beginning of syllables, instead of saying
      {tlh,} Morskans say something that sounds very much like a combination of
      standard Klingon {gh} and {l}---that is, {ghl}. Compare, for example
      (Morskan/{ta' Hol}):</p>
    <blockquote>
      {ghIts}/{ghItlh} (“write”)
      <br>{mats}/{matlh} (“be loyal”)
      <br>{ghlIngan}/{tlhIngan} (“Klingon”)
      <br>{ghlo'}/{tlho'} (“thank”)
      <br>{ghluts}/{tlhutlh} (“drink”)
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Morskan dialect also pronounces {H} differently from the standard
      way. At the beginning of syllables, {H} sounds like Federation
      Standard <i>h</i> as in <i>hat</i>; at the ends of syllables, {H} is not
      pronounced at all:</p>
    <blockquote>
      {hIv}/{HIv} (“attack”)
      <br>{ba}/{baH} (“fire [a torpedo]”)
      <br>{hu}/{HuH} (“bile”)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Finally, {Q} at the beginning of syllables is pronounced the same as
      standard Klingon {H}:</p>
    <blockquote>
      {Hapla'}/{Qapla'} (“success”)
      <br>{Hoy}/{Qoy} (“hear”)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Because of this pronunciation difference, sometimes speakers of the
      Morskan dialect and those of {ta' Hol} misunderstand one another. Words
      such as the following have been responsible for the loss of more than one
      life:</p>
    <blockquote>
      {Hagh}: Morskan, “make a mistake”/Standard, “laugh”
      <br>{Hoj}: Morskan, “make war”/Standard, “be cautious”
      <br>{HoS}: Morskan, “be sorry”/Standard, “be strong”
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <p>Although the basic grammar of all dialects of Klingon is the same, there
      is some variation. The Morskan dialect, for example, does not put the
      suffix {-'e'} on the subject noun in a sentence translated with “to be”
      in Federation Standard (though the suffix is not missing in other
      contexts where it is used to focus attention on one noun rather than
      another within the sentence). Compare:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Morskan: {tera'ngan gha qama'.} (“The prisoner is a Terran.”)
      <br>Standard: {tera'ngan ghaH qama''e'} ({tera'ngan,} “Terran”; {ghaH,}
      “he, she”; {qama',} “prisoner”)
      <br>Morskan: {bIghha'Daq ghata qama'.} (“The prisoner is in the
      prison.”)
      <br>Standard: {bIghHa'Daq ghaHtaH qama''e'.} ({bIghHa'Daq,} “in the
      prison”; {-taH,} “continuous”)
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes the {-'e'} is heard at the end of the subject noun in Morskan
      sentences of this type ({qama'} [“prisoner”] in the examples above),
      leading some speakers of {ta' Hol} to criticize speakers of the Morskan
      dialect for sloppiness, claiming that sometimes the {-'e'} is heard and
      other times not, with no apparent pattern. The critics are wrong: {-'e'}
      added to {qama'} in the Morskan sentences would have its usual focusing
      function (the sentences would mean something like “It’s the prisoner
      who’s a Terran” and “It’s the prisoner who’s in the prison,”
      respectively), the same as it would have in sentences of other types.
      This grammatical device is not available to speakers of {ta' Hol} who, to
      speak grammatically, must use {-'e'} in sentences of this type whether
      wishing to call extra attention to the subject noun or not. <small>[KGT
      pp. 22--24]</small></p>

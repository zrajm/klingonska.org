It's an Okrandesque pun, but did it come from Okrand?

loghaD:
> Got the book in front of me now. It's on page 107:
>
> "The surgeon typically injects a combined stimulant and pain killer, before using a {petqaD} to bond broken bones in place and a dermal regenerator to suture any wounds. Typical turnaround times allow an injured crewman to return to his post within seven minutes."
>
> This is in the segment labeled {HaqwI'}, which also claims that this word literally means "bone mender".

It's this sort of thing in the book which makes me question whether
the Klingon that appears in it is reliable.

I still don't understand why, but several people have asked for {boQwI'} to
have a {DIvI' tu'qom}.

--- begin quote ---
For “mode,” use {lo’} “use” (noun).  “Night mode” would be {ram lo’} “night
use, night usage.”  “Search mode” could be {SammeH lo’}.  ({nejmeH lo’}
also works; depends on how confident you are in your search engine
apparently.) “Lesson mode” could be {ghojmeH mIw lo’}.

For “theme,” {tu’qom} “appearance, configuration” should work.

  Author: De'vID (transcript of glossary vetted by Marc Okrand)
  Summary: Posting of De'vID's Transcript of the Klingon glossary from
    "Diplomatic Implausibility" by Keith R.A. DeCandido (ISBN 978-0671785543,
    published 1 February 2001). The acknowledgements section of this book
    remarks that Marc Okrand kept the "linguistics straight and vetted the

As promised, I've typed the Klingon glossary to this novel.  In 
print, the Anglicized words (e.g. bat'leth) are in bold, and their 
{pIqaD} transcription (e.g. betleH) are in bold italic.  For most
entries the Anglicized word begins the entry followed by
the {pIqaD} in brackets.  I won't reproduce the typeface here.

The glossary also contains the English words of the Warrior's
Anthem (the Klingon text is found in the book) which I won't
retype since it's available elsewhere.

As malqa said, the Acknowledgments include MO, who "vetted the [[Acknowledgments:=Acknowledgements]]
glossary". 

To keep the lawyers happy: "Buy the book!  Buy the book!" 

(If anyone sees any typos, send 'em to me and I'll collate and
post corrections if necessary later in the week.)

--- begin ---

    bat'leth (betleH)  Curved, four-bladed, two-handed weapon.
This is the most popular handheld, edged weapon used by Klingon

of Kahless was a bat'leth, and most Defense Force warriors are
proficient with it.  [First seen in "Reunion" (TNG).]

Force.  [First referenced in "Sons and Daughters" (DS9).]

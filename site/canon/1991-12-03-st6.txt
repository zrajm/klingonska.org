  Type: movie
  Date: 6 December 1991
  Title: <Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country>
  Publisher: Paramount Pictures
  Summary: Marc Okrand was again hired to write the Klingon dialogue, and coach
    the actors. There’s quite a lot of dialogue in Klingon in this movie, and
    we even get some examples of different Klingon dialects (that were
    intentional, and not just the result of actor’s varying pronunciation).
    Usually abbreviated <ST6>, though sometimes abbreviated <ST:TUC>.

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country

Angle brackets indicate <uncertainties> in the transcription due to muttered
dialogue, background music or sound effects. There are also excerpts from J.M.
Dillard's novelization which may reflect an earlier version of Nicholas Meyer &
Denny Martin Flinn's screenplay (story by Leonard Nimoy, Nicholas Meyer and
Denny Martin Flinn) used by the novelist in her adaptation. The tlhIngan Hol in
the movies is actually pretty good; Marc Okrand himself coached many of the
actors. Though this film had a lot of Klingon, much of it was untranslated in
the background, muted and strangely distorted.

         Note: Originally the line was {yIn pagh yInbe'}. But when shooting the
         scene, the actor Christopher Plummer didn't feel it sounded “Klingon
         enough” so Okrand quickly changed it to {taH}.

Crossing the Klingon border at Morska Listening Post.        [01:14:01]

        Note: The officer at the Morska outpost is definitely speaking with an
        unusual accent, and might be using what the core of the empire would
        consider archaic speech. For example, when he was referring "that
        ship", he clearly said Dujvetz. There's no tz sound in "High Klingon"
        (as we study it on this list); it's apparently a dialectical variant of
        {tlh}. /ghunchu'wI'

Kesla:  {morISqa' jIH.}

	the novel, she was speaking in an "odd, archaic dialect."

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier

The below transcript have been constructed from several sources.

  * De'vID's excellent ST5 transcript.
  * The "Revised Final" ST5 screenplay (dated November 21, 1988).
  * {HolQeD} 8:4 article (p11--13), with notes on "The Final Frontier".
  * The movie itself.
  * The deleted scenes extras from the ST5 Special Edition DVD.

This transcript uses the same format as the ST5 screenplay as far as
possible. The Klingon dialogue (which is missing from the official
screenplays) have been added (in curly brackets), and occasional comments
have been added in double brackets [[...]].

The Klingon material added is both from the "Notes from ~Star Trek V: The
Final Frontier~" article in {HolQeD} 8:4, and De'vID's transcript of ST5.
But all has been carefully checked against the primary sources (i.e. the
movies and DVD extras).

Closed captions are missing from this transcript.

===============================================================================

The translations in parentheses are the (subtitles) as they appear in the movie
followed by the [closed captions] in brackets, which was helpful in places
where there were no subtitles. Angle brackets indicate <uncertainties> in the
transcription due to muttered dialogue, background music or sound effects. I
have added excerpts from J.M. Dillard's novelization in {curly brackets} which
may reflect an earlier version of David Loughery's screenplay (story by William
Shatner, Harve Bennett and David Loughery) used by the novelist in her
adaptation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Klingon lines from scenes in an earlier draft of the script missing from the
final cut (but included in the novelization) are in [square brackets]. Some of
them were published in HolQeD 8.4:12-13.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Inside the commercially available script for Star Trek V: The Final Frontier
you won't find much Klingon. The lines designated to be spoken in Klingon
appear, parenthetically, in English. During the making of the film Marc Okrand
created notes and tapes for the Klingon actors to work from in preparing their
lines." (Lawrence Schoen in HolQeD 8.4)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Okrand mentioned [at qep'a'] that though he was present for the filming of the
Klingon scenes, he was not there when the subtitles were inserted. Probably
what happened is that someone (unfamiliar with Klingon) ... was involved in
putting the subtitles..." (SuSvaj, 7/28/06)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Yesterday I had the occasion to view the extras on the Star Trek V and VI
special edition DVDs (on the second disks). I don't know if they've already
been discussed here, but there are some things that are of interest to
Klingonists. There's a short segment on the Star Trek VI disc on the Klingon
language in which Dr. Lawrence Schoen makes an appearance. There are interviews
with the actors who played Klingons on both discs. The one on Star Trek V is
called "That Klingon Couple" with the subtitle {tlhIngan chang'engvetlh}. While
their lines in Star Trek V had a few problems that may annoy some Klingonists,
the actors themselves had an excellent attitude towards learning the Klingon
and took it very quite seriously. I was very impressed with that aspect of
things. ... The most interesting thing for Klingonists is probably the deleted
scene in which some Klingon was spoken by General Koord to Romulan Ambassador
Caithlin Dar at Paradise City when they first meet.

"At one point, Spice Williams exclaims "Brilliant!" and the word {chong!} is
shown in the subtitle (all Klingon subtitles in this segment are given in Roman
font). At another point she is describing her reaction to being hired for the
movie, and says 'Wow, wow! For Star Trek! Omigosh!', and the subtitle said
{yay, yay! Hov lengvaD! baQa'!} (Okay, I'm sure {yay} is a joke and isn't
actually the Klingon way of saying wow. But it's cute.) She describes a scene
from the movie (near the end) by saying the line "Oh, what wonderful muscles",
and the subtitle was {toH, Somraw'Du' Dunqu'.} (That's not a typo on my part,
the <'> is there on *{Somraw'} in the subtitle.)

"Todd Bryant at one point asks Spice Williams if she remembers "that {Hoch Dun
puS} line", and the subtitle said {Hoch Dun puS}. Then she looked up as if
trying to remember it, and said something which was subtitled as {'entepray'
Hub patmey luchu'be'}. Was this line in the movie? I didn't find it or a line
like it in the movie, and I don't know if it's a deleted line that she
remembered, or if she misremembered a line and whoever did the subtitles
re-constructed it from what she said. (It does sound like that's what she said.
If she remembered a deleted line after all these years then she has an amazing
memory! A line like that--"They didn't activate Enterprise's defense
systems"--would be perfect near the end of the movie when the Bird-of-Prey
catches the Enterprise unawares.)

"There's another deleted scene that was supposed to show that there was a
romantic relationship between Klaa and Vixis. Presumably they're speaking
Klingon in that scene, but unfortunately the commentary talks over it and you
can't hear what's being said. (Anyone know how to read lips in Klingon? :) )

"I wonder who supplied the subtitles. Was Okrand, or someone from KLI, involved
in this? The subtitles are much better than the usual Paramount attempts at
Klingon done without Okrand's help, and the little joke using {yay} to
translate wow is quite characteristic of Okrand." (De'vID jonwI' [5/2003])

              33   INT. BACK ROOM                                                33

                   The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face
                   and is revealed to be a young woman. A Romulan. Her
                   name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold
                   of the room. She's a little nervous and a long way
                   from home.

                   The back room is an area for unwanted odds and ends.
                   TWO MEN are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends of a
                   table. The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly
                   swivels his head in her direction. He's a Terran
                   (specifically, an Englishman) named ST. JOHN TALBOT.
                   Thin and dissipated, alcoholic, Talbot is a veteran of
                   the diplomatic corps.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             Gentlemen, I'm Caithlin Dar.

                   Talbot puffs out a cloud of smoke and slowly stands
                   up. He speaks with his cigarette still in his mouth.

                                           TALBOT
                             Oh, yeah. Our new Romulan represent-
                             ative. Welcome to Paradise City, my
                             dear, capital of the so-called "Planet
                             of Galactic Peace." I'm St. John
                             Talbot, the Federation representative
                             here on Nimbus III and my charming
                             companion is the Klingon consul
                             Korrd.

                   Caithlin regards the hulking figure on the other end
                   of the table. KORRD is an old, overweight Klingon, a
                   once great warrior now past his prime. He doesn't
                   rise to greet Caithlin. Instead, he takes a swig from
                   a flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch.

                                           CAITHLIN
                             I expect that's Klingon for hello.

                                           TALBOT
                             Won't you come in, my dear?

                   J'onn is looking out across the desert from a dune,
                   clutching his crude pipe gun. Coming up from behind
                   him Sybok approaches, mounted on his horse, and then
                   ride majestically past. After Sybok comes a small army
                   of ragged settlers, drawing up dust as they pass.

              XX   ANGLE - PARADISE CITY                                         XX

                   Beyond a stretch of desert lies, Paradise City, a
                   small ramshackle village smack in the middle of no-
                   where, surrounded by high walls. The small army moves
                   onward towards the city.

                             Twenty years ago when our three
                             governments agreed to develop this
                             planet together, a new age was born.

                             Our new age died a quick death, and
                             the settlers we conned into coming
                             here -- they were the dregs of the
                             galaxy -- immediately took to
                             fighting amongst themselves. We
                             forbade them weapons -- they soon
                             began to fashion their own.

                   Further argument is interrupted by shouts from outside
                   and the whine of a warning klaxon.

                   A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate.
                   It suddenly gives way. Camera climbs up over the top
                   of the arch to reveal Sybok's army on the threshold
                   of the city. In their midst, towering majestically
                   above them, is Sybok on horseback. He urges his mount
                   forward. With quiet determination, he and his army pour
                   under the arch and proceed up the main drag.

                   Townspeople scurrying for protection, anticipating an
                   attack. Those who consider challenging Sybok are
                   allayed by the crude weapons and intimidating looks
                   of his followers. Sybok intends to take this town by
                   show of force without having to fire a shot. And it
                   looks like he'll succeed.

                   A NASA Pioneer probe tumbles through space. Ancient,
                   forgotten, the device is flotsam. On it's side is a
                   plaque showing image of two humans and simple mathe-
                   matical and scientific symbols. It comes past camera
                   and out of this distortion, _a Klingon Bird of Prey_
                   _materializes_.

                   Doors seperate to admit KLAA, the Bird of Prey's
                   swashbuckling young captain. He is met by VIXIS, his
                   first officer, a statuesque Klingon female. It's
                   clear she adores Klaa.

                                           VIXIS

                             (Difficult to hit?)

                                           VIXIS
                             {Qatlhqu'.}
                             (Most difficult.)

                             (Good.)

                   Klaa's crew watches with excitement as their captain
                   straps himself into his command chair which has been
                   equipped with an elaborate gunner's rig allowing
                   Klaa to do the shooting himself.

                                           KLAA
                             {vISeHmeH Hoch nuHmey Qay!}
                             (All weapons to my control.)
                             (Scope!)

                   A periscope-like device swings into position in front
                   of Klaa's flashing eyes.

              46   PERISCOPE - KLAA'S POV                                        46

                   The probe is a tiny traveling speck in the distance.
                   Its course is erratic.

              47   EXT. SPACE                                                    47

                   The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey
                   swoops down for the attack. Machine gun-like phasers
                   are mounted on the Bird's wings. They come to life
                   and swivel, blasting a flange off the front of the
                   probe. A second blast destroys a fin on the rear of
                   the craft. A third shot blows away the antennae.
                   Klaa is toying with the target.

              48   INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE                                    48

                   The crew cheers each hit. They admire their captain
                   and his deadly skill. But Klaa seems dissatisfied.
                   He hesitates finishing the probe off.

                   Klaa unstraps himself from the command chair and joins
                   Vixis at a monitor screen. The fearsome face of A
                   KLINGON COMMANDER fills the screen and starts barking
                   Klingon over shots of Nimbus III and the Paradise
                   outpost. It's clear the Bird of Prey is being ordered

                   As Vixis and the crew hop to it, camera pushes in on
                   Klaa who throws off his gunner's rig, unable to hide
                   his admiration for Kirk's cleverness.

                   Vixis turns to Klaa. Klaa barks an order to his helms-
                   man.

                   Kirk materializes. He's immediately seized by two brutal-
                   looking Klingons.

                                           GUARD 1
                             {HIghoS!}

                             {Ha'!}

                   They march him out of the transporter room.

                   The bridge doors slide open and Kirk is brought in The
                   Klingon crew regard him from their stations. Klaa is
                   off to one side looking petulant. Korrd stands beside
                   him, chest puffed up with pride, obviously in charge.

                                           KORRD
                                     (to the guards)
                             Release him.

                   [[Marc Okrand prepared the phrase {yIjonHa'!}
                   for use here, but it was never used in the
                   movie.]]

                   The guards step away from Kirk. Klaa glares at Korrd
                   but it's clear the older Klingon is now calling the
                   shots.

                   Kirk regards Korrd with surprise.

                                           KORRD
                                     (continuing)
                             Kirk, my junior officer has something he
                             wants to say to you.

                                           KORRD
                                     (to Klaa)

                                     (to Klaa again)
                             {maj. 'ej...}
                             [untranslated]

                                     (continuing)

                             authorized by my government.

                                          KORRD
                             Kirk, and now, may I present our new gunner.

                   The command chair swivels around to reveal its
                   occupant to be Spock. He unstraps himself from the
                   gunner's rig, stands up and straightens his uniform in
                   a dignified manner.

                                           KIRK
                             Spock?

                             Welcome aboard, Captain.

                   Kirk regards the stoic Spock with affection and
                   wonder.

                                           KIRK
                                     (can't believe it)
                             Spock, I thought I was going to die.

                                           SPOCK
                             Not possible. You were never alone.

                   Kirk eyes Spock then approaches him as if to embrace
                   him.

                                           SPOCK
                                     (continuing)
                             Please, Captain, not in front of
                             the Klingons.

                   Kirk looks around and notices the Klingon crew, then
                   he and Spock nod in acknowledgement to each other.

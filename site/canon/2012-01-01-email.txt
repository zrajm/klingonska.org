WARNING: New canon from Klingon Monopoly.  Avoid this thread if you want to
learn the new words directly from the game yourself.

I believe all the words from the box and game board have been posted
already.

Here are the new words or new/novel uses of known words from the Combat and
Honor cards:

{SIbI'Ha'} adv. later, eventually (discussed in another thread)
{le'mIS} n. blockade
{wun} v. be unprotected, be vulnerable
{ngIq} adv. each (we also saw this from {paq'batlh})
{chIm} v. be drained (referring to dilithium crystals; addition to known
meanings)
{mI' nagh} n. dice, die
{ron} v. roll, be rolling (of playing dice; addition to known meaning as
aircraft term)
{ronmoH} v. roll, throw (playing dice)
{jorwI'} n. bomb (extension of "n. explosive" meaning)
{ghay} v. spray, bombard? (can take {jorwI'} as its object; known
previously from {bIQ ghaywI' pa'} n. shower (room))
{tlhapqa'} v. retrieve (obvious application of suffix {-qa'} to {tlhap})
{rIt} v. summon
{tlhIngan 'IH qaD} n. Klingon beauty contest (see below)
{qarDaSQa'} n. Cardassian Union (more evidence for *{Qa'} as an element
with similar meaning to {DIvI'})
{ruDelya' rop'a'} n. Rudellian plague

The beauty contest one is from the sentence {tlhIngan 'IH qaD DaQap} "Win
Klingon Beauty Contest".  I'm not sure if *{'IH qaD} can be separated out
as a noun meaning "beauty contest" (which would imply the existence of
*{'IH} n. beauty).  It can also be parsed as {tlhIngan 'IH} plus {qaD},
that is, a contest for a beautiful Klingon, so {'IH} is probably a verb
here.

Someone with more time than me can type out the full sentences in which
these appear.

Please correct any errors or let me know if I've missed anything.

pItlh.

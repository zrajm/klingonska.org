  Summary: Some further discussion on the origins of the new body part words
    from the 2011 Saarbrücken {qepHom'a'}: {cha'neH}, {'IvtIH}, {rajma'},
    {'eQway} and the (previously known) {lev} ~hard palate, roof of the mouth~.

Qov had actually used <'IvtIH> in her story at some point.  The sentence
was <'IvtIHDu'Daj 'uch Mahoun>, so I inferred it was a body part.
ghunchu'wI' appeared to know it, so I wrote it down as a new word.  This
was before the qepHom.

At the qepHom, I happened to talk to 'ISqu' about this word, and she showed
me a list of five words she'd typed out from a previous qep'a', under the
title <porgh 'ay'>: the above four plus <lev> which I already had in my own
dictionary.  All five words were parts of the body.  She also had
definitions.  However, I didn't want to post the definitions I copied from
her, since our definitions of <lev> differed slightly: my notes say "n.
hard palate, roof of mouth (source: qep'a' 12)", and her definition simply
said "n. palate".  So she may have abbreviated her definitions, or perhaps
my source had elaborated it (link: http://klingon.livejournal.com/26647.html,
from http://www.kli.org/tlh/newwords.html).

If someone else has seen the above four words before, please post the
definitions you have.  Otherwise, I'll post the ones I copied from her in a
little bit.

  Title: [Tlhingan-hol] learnings from Saarbr端cken {qepHom'a'}
  Author: De'vID
  Summary: A list of new words (without definitions) from the 2011 Saarbr端cken
    {qepHom'a'}: {'IvtIH}, {rajma'}, {'eQway}, {cha'neH}, {ren}, {Qur} and
    *{qurbuSwI'} (Morskan?). Some clarifications on usage of {ghur} ~increase~,
    {nup} ~decrease~, and the difference between {reH} and {Quj} (both meaning
    ~to play~).

Subject: [Tlhingan-hol] learnings from Saarbr端cken qepHom'a'

I've already written several messages about things we learned at the
qepHom'a' in Saarbr端cken, Germany.  I'll write down the rest of what I
saw/heard here before I forget.

I saw several new words (words new to me; they may already be known to
others):
<'IvtIH>
<rajma'>
<'eQway>
<cha'neH>
<ren>
<Qur>
<qurbuSwI'> (Morskan?)

I don't have definitions from MO for the first four words, only what I saw
in others' notes.  The words <ren>, <Qur>, and <qurbuSwI'> were defined in
writing, but only in German, in a letter from MO.  Presumably, the letter
was written in English, and translated into German (by Lieven?), but I have
not seen the original.  However, I've had the meanings of <ren> and <Qur>
explained to me by German speakers.  <qurbuSwI'> appears to be a Morskan
dialect word, but I didn't understand its meaning.  Perhaps Lieven, or
someone who can read the letter in German, can explain their definitions.

We also learned that the verbs <ghur> and <nup> are intransitive (the
transitive forms have <-moH>), and also what the difference was between the
verbs <reH> and <Quj>.  <reH> applies to unstructured play, whereas <Quj>
refers to structured play (with rules).

The following is not new info, but was discussed with MO at the qepHom:
<Soj> refers not just to food, but anything consumed for sustenance (i.e.,
"food" in a more general sense than "solid food"); <Sop>, <tlhutlh>, and
<'ep> are verbs which can be applied to different kinds of <Soj>.

<h2>An Update, July 2022</h2>

<p>The last printed version of this dictionary was made back in 2010, and since
then I have not worked on this project. Unfortunately, no up-to-date version of
this dictionary exists. :'(

<p>This dictionary was created on the cheap, but I tried to make it neatly
looking and as durable as I could. It was printed on a laser printer, the cover
being printed on an extra thick sheet of paper, and wrapped in protective
self-adhesive plastic, with a strip of black duct tape for the spine.) – The
result was a little book actually looks <i>better</i> after a couple of weeks
in your back pocket.

<p>At some point I attempted to create an updated dictionary (including all new
words up to that point) but concluded that this would require more pages than
could be stabled together in one bunch (above a certain point the sheets fold
only awkwardly, and the middle pages tend to break loose very easily). A newer
version would thus require a more complicated binding, meaning that it might
have to be professionally printed. <i>That</i> is not likely to happen.

<p>Many thanks to all of you that have expressed an interest in the book over
the years! (And especially all you lovely Klingonists in Saarbrücken!) If you
want to try to create a similar dictionary for yourself,
both <a href="https://github.com/zrajm/paqhom">my source code</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/zrajm/klingonska.org/blob/master/site/dict/dict.zdb">the
human-readable data file</a> is freely available on Github.

<h2 id=about>About the Pocket Dictionary</h2>

<p>Here are some images of the most recent (7th) edition of the pocket
dictionary. The CD-record in the background is included for size comparison.
The black markings on the edge are my own and indicate where the different
sections (Klingon&ndash;English Dictionary / English&ndash;Klingon Dictionary /
Suffix Guide) are located in the book. Click on any of the thumbnails for a
larger picture.</p>

<p class=blank>These pages reflect the contents of the current version
of <i>Klingonska Akademien</i>’s pocket-sized Klingon/English
dictionary <b lang=tlh>tlhI­ngan Hol mu’­ghom mach</b>. The book is intended as
a complement to Marc Okrand’s <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> (Simon &amp;
Schuster, <time>1992</time>, ISBN 0-671-74559-X) and does, because of this and
because of size considerations, not contain any description of the grammar.
Included is, however (as you will find out if you take a look around these
pages), Klingon&ndash;English and English&ndash;Klingon dictionary sections, a
brief pronunciation guide (including stress), and reference tables
for <b lang=tlh>pI­qaD</b>, pronunciation, and prefix and suffix usage.</p>

<p>The first edition of this dictionary was created in <time>1997</time>, since
then I have continued to use and improve it (I always carry one with me). The
seventh edition was finished in <time datetime="2002-01">January 2002</time>
and it contains a new, more complete <i><a href="suffix.html">Suffix
Guide</a></i> as the most notable addition.</p>

<p>If you are would like to obtaining a copy then feel free to contact me about
it. If you’re really into Klingon I’d be happy to provide you with one, but if
you are just looking for something to impress your friends with, then I
recommend you buy <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> instead. It will look a lot
more impressive in your book shelf. (Besides, if you just want to impress your
friends, a Klingon <em>costume</em> is what you should be looking for.) Since
there is no description of the Klingon grammar in the dictionary, it will be
quite useless to you if you don’t know at least <em>some</em> Klingon.</p>

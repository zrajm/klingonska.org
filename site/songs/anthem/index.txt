Hilary Bader's Lyrics
---------------------
Hear! Sons of Kahless.
<br>Hear! Daughters too.
<br>The blood of battle washes clean.
<br>The warrior brave and true.
<br>We fight, we love, and then we kill.
<br>Our lives burn short and bright.
<br>Then we die with honor and join our fathers
<br>     in the Black Fleet where we battle forever,
<br>     battling on through the Eternal fight.


Literal Translation
-------------------
Hear, sons of Kahless!
<br>Hear, daughters!
<br>The battle's blood perfectly cleans
<br>the warrior who is brave and loyal.
<br>We fight, we are passionate, and we kill perfectly.
<br>Our lives are not long, but they are very bright.
<br>We will certainly die with honor, and we will join our fathers in
<br>     the black fleet. There we will continue to *fight*.
<br>     We will not stop. We will continue to fight. We will compete.

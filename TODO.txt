** TODO Fix <h1> element CSS warning
   klingonska.org CSS warning:
   Found a sectioned h1 element with no specified font-size or margin
   properties. More information:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#specify_font-size_and_margin-block_on_h1
** TODO Stop using Makefile to build?
   Instead of using a Makefile to build the web page, would it be possible to
   skip the build step entirely? If required, add Git hooks to verify that
   committed content is in sync/valid etc.

   This would require the whole page to use nothing but client side (Javscript)
   'decryption' (of some canon source materials) and possible Markdown to HTML
   conversion, and removal of all types of minification. But this is maybe
   acceptable today?
** TODO Replace old http:// links with no-protocol links
** TODO Restrict access to 'encrypted' docs in Okrandian Archive   :SECURITY:
   Currently transcripts of TKD, KGT etc are directly available through the
   Archive of Okrandian Canon. These should be store 'encrypted' on the server
   and be decrypted by Javascript.
   https://klingonska.org/canon/

   Maybe using a URLs schema like this?
   https://klingonska.org/canon/search/?file=1993-10-01-pk.txt
** TODO Clean out HTML5 boilerplate from top of base.scss
** TODO Check (remove?) 'rel=canonical' links
   These shouldn't be needed since all alternative pages redirect to the
   correct one? (`www.klingonska.org` redirects to `klingonska.org` etc)
** TODO Upgrade jQuery newest version
** TODO Use Elemental instead of jQuery? (it's smaller)
** TODO Search engine for Firefox
   In Firefox search engines can be added by clicking on the menu next to the
   search field. If you go to YouTube their search engine appears in the menu,
   i.e. "Add YouTube to search engines" (or something similar). With
   Klingonska one should be able to add the dictionary search in this way.
** TODO CSS: "display: inline" on floats avoids (avoid double margin in MSIE)
** TODO CSS: "overflow: visible" on buttons (avoids padding issues in MSIE)
** TODO CSS: Remove unnecessary styles for <input>
   What's needed exactly? Currently there's a whole bunch of creating then
   overriding <input> widgets to get buttons to look pretty, but <button> is
   used instead of <input type=submit> everywhere on the site.
** TODO Replace underscore in URLs with hyphen
   Hyphens are easier to type, prettier to look (narrower) at and seem to be
   emerging as a standard for separating words is URLs on the web.

   Apparently Google (and other search engines?) treats and underscore as a
   word joiner (so "red_sneakers" = "redsneakers") and hyphen as a word
   separator (so "red-sneakers" = "red sneakers"). So from a SEO perspective
   using dashes over underscores have a (minor) ranking benefit.
** TODO Change thumbnail names *.thmb.* -> mini/*
   Thumbnail should also (typically at least) be PNGs, to allow for transparent
   backgrounds. E.g. see http://klingonska.org/songs/tahjaj_wo/ *_m.* and
   *_sml.* is also in use for thumbnails (or smallish pictures), these should
   all become mini/* as well.
* [4/13] Site design
** TODO Add dark mode
   Add a CSS-only for dark mode (no Javascript) and a toggle switch in the top
   right corner of every page.
** TODO Mobile friendly margins                                   :IMPORTANT:
   Use a CSS media query to remove the wide page margins when displayed on cell
   phones and other small screens. (But not on iPad?)
** TODO Redesign search field to use rounded corners
** TODO Add link to Github issue tracker
   To allow for user feedback. Put link at bottom of each page?
   https://github.com/zrajm/klingonska.org/issues
** TODO Make pretty hyphenations(?)
   Justified right margin + hyphenation? That would be pretty. This page
   suggests how to do it: http://alistapart.com/article/the-look-that-says-book

   Could we do Graceful degradation of this?

   Hyphenator.js could be useful.
** TODO Cleanup breadcrumbs
   Some breadcrums use '&#8250;' other use '&gt;' should prolly just '&gt;' (it
   doesn't look all that much worse, and is guaranteed to work with a larger
   range of browsers).
** TODO Default tables should be borderless
   It is hard to unstyle a table, so the default table should behave very much
   like the default HTML table, i.e. it should be borderless, have collapsing
   borders, and probably no paddings and margins.

   My fave table with 2px black border should have 'class=border' or somesuch.
** TODO First-line indented paragraphs
   Many pages have the first line of each paragraph indented, rather a blank
   line between each paragraph. This should be achieved with a some class name
   (on a <div> or the main content div of that page). Inside such <div>s, <hr>
   should not be displayed, but only cause a blank line + non-indenting of
   first line of the next paragraph.

   This makes for pretty Markdown, since it can be written in the usual way,
   using '* * *' on a line by itself to make larger breaks in the text.

   Markdown should detect this mode by some metadata field.
** TODO Change link colors + remove underline
   Underlining really diminishes readability especially when used with IPA (as
   on http://klingonska.lal/piqad/) or in tables where much data consist of
   links.

   It's important that links stand out, however, so maybe more traditional link
   colors should be used. Maybe just the traditional? (unvisited: #00e,
   visited: #551a8b, and hover/active: #06e). Or a slightly darker version
   thereof:

       a         { color: #11a; text-decoration: none; }
       a:visited { color: #516; }
       a:hover   { opacity: .65; }

   Following the example set by GitHub (e.g. in commit messages in the 'Commit'
   view) -- why not also use 'text-decoration: underline;' as the hover style
   of links, but remove 'text-decoration: none;' for the usual style?
** [22%] Optimize page sizes

   On CSS optimization:

   CLOSED: [2012-12-30 Sun 17:57]
   Turns out text-stroke is not needed after all. Just more careful text-shadows.

   Text shadow on the "Klingonska Akademien" text have gaps. CSS property
   'text-stroke' is supported by Chrome, and should be used (with the current
   'text-shadow' used as fallback).

   How to do this:
   http://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/

   Browser support table:
   http://caniuse.com/text-stroke

   'filter' property could apparently be used to get it flying in Internet
   Explorer. This question on stackoverflow have a CSS for that (which uses the
   html5boilerplate html classes):

** DONE Allow -*- html -*- to be added to Markdown metadata
   CLOSED: [2013-05-30 Thu 18:42]
   So that Emacs understand immediately that the file should use html-mode.

   bin/markdown2html now allows comments in metadata. Simply use ':' (without
   preceding it with a field name -- continuation lines cannot be used after
   comments).

   With this in place, the first line of a markdown source file may contain the
   line `: -*- html -*-` to signify that Emacs should highlight it as if it was
   HTML.
** DONE Use a 'natural box model' for all of page
   CLOSED: [2014-11-02 Sun 21:41]
   See Paul Irish's web page:
   http://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/

       /* apply a natural box layout model to all elements */
       html { box-sizing: border-box; }
       *, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; }

   `includes/gallery.scss` have a couple of exceptions from this rule since the
   <figure> element have its size set (in the HTML) according to the size of
   the image it contains.
** DONE Prettify tab row (make more Chrome-like)

   I.e. changes that need to be applied to the web page as a whole.
*** TODO Use source abbreviations reccomended by Klingonwiki
    http://www.klingonwiki.net/En/Abbreviations
*** TODO Improve table centering
    Fill tables (called 'fill tables' since they can fill the page
    horizontally, but grow no wider than that) are used with dialogue or
    example sentences:
      * Can't grow wider than the page.
      * Left aligned (but indented). Not transform-translated.
      * Not sortable.
      * No borders.
    FIXME: left alignment, remove transform-translate.

    Figure tables (and <figure>):
      * Can grow wider than page (if content is wide enough).
      * Are centered on page (even if content is wider than page). This is
        achieved with 'transform: translated'.
      * Not sortable.
      * No borders.
    FIXME: remove transform-translate(?)

    Reference tables:
      * Can't grow wider than the page.
      * Centered. (But do not need 'transform: translate'.
      * Sortable.
      * Borders.

    A reference table:

        | Klingon  | English       | Reference |
        |----------+---------------+-----------|
        | {DaH}    | <<now>> (adv) | [TKD]     |
        | {DaHjaj} | <<today>> (n) | [TKD]     |
        |----------+---------------+-----------|
*** TODO Improve table sortability
    Can all tables (with headers) be made sortable? (e.g. on /download.html)

    Replace 'includes/sorttable.js' with something that can be minified It
    should also pass JSLint.

    Note that some files (e.g. `punct.html` uses sorttable's
    "sorttable_customkey" attribute, which will probably have to be rewritten if
    `sorttable.js` is replaced. It would be especially cool if the sort script
    could take some comparison function so we could sort by Klingon.
*** TODO Make source reference style consistent
    Currently some sources [TKD] etc. are grey colored, others are set in
    <small> -- unify this!

    Brackets should be added by the CSS, so that we may strip them when
    needed.

    When a source reference is used alone in a table cell, maybe there should
    be no brackets or coloring of it? Maybe use a selector like the following?

        td > XXX:first-child:last-child

    tkw.html = grey, Same with dates in menus. Note that some sources are on
    green or red background (e.g. in /piqad/), so grey should be
    `rgba(0,0,0,.5)` or something similar

    As it is now it looks a bit weird with the small font when it occurs
    alone, since the line height is not adjusted. Grey would look better
    there. (e.g. last menu item on the /akademien/ page).

    Source references need to look good when used in the middle of a block of
    text (where a light grey would maybe look weird?), at the end of a long
    text, and when occurring all by itself in a table cell.
*** TODO Replace <br>nbsp-nbsp-nbsp with <p class=indent> + CSS
*** TODO Drop margins for <p> used inside a <td>
    CSS should also reduce margins in tables and similar? Useful especially
    since that mean <p class=indent> can be used inside table cells instead of
    <br>nbsp-nbsp-nbsp.
*** TODO Use <main> tag(?)
*** TODO Hexagon used as list bullet should be SVG, not bitmap
*** TODO Read up on SMACSS apply those principles to CSS
    http://smacss.com/
*** [0%] Social network interactivity
**** TODO Same button design as The New Zealand Herald?
     http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11142421
     These are cool, not least cause the CSS look very fine, even without
     Javascript.

     Could these buttons be implemented as CGI (using "target=_top")? Maybe
     even the like digits could be small static web pages included by means of
     iframes?
**** TODO Add Google+ 1+ button

**** DONE CSS animation fading the logo glow in the page header
     CLOSED: [2014-11-18 tis 23:22]
     The page logo glows on hover. This should fade in, rather than just light

**** DONE Design new look (more modern looking, but still simple)
     CLOSED: [2012-06-09 Sat 11:21]
     This should fix:
       * Limiting line 'max-width' for readability
       * Niftier design with a splash of red color in the header
       * Using updated web standards (HTML5, Javascript, microdata etc.)
       * Use HTML5 Boilerplate
       * Building (minified) CSSes from SCSS (Sassy Stylesheets)
       * Using a HTML template = centralized header/footer
       * Page source (whenever possible) in markdown

      They're not really interesting/relevant, since all the interesting parts

        This required an update of `parse-data/composer-html-ka2`, and since
        transformations (thought of when originally wrote `bin/parse`, but not
        implemented then) were needed to produce correctly formed HTML, those
        had to be properly added as well.

      Example of this not looking so good:

      found on pages:

***** TODO Breadcrumbs should support 'up' metadata field
      The next-to-last breadcrumb link should be the page pointed to by the
      'up' metadata field (if it exists). This will (at least mostly) solve the
      the paginated page breadcrumb problem as well, by defining 'up' for all
      paginated pages.

      Breadcrumbs for multiple page article
      Example: http://klingonska.org/akademien/foton/2.html

      Home › Om Klingonska Akademien › Pictures from {qep’a’ SochDIch} (page 1)
      › Pictures from {qep’a’ SochDIch} (page 2)

      Page 2 should not include page 1 in the breadcrumbs and logo link should
      link to above directory for all pages.

      Same goes for http://klingonska.org/dict/, where the logo should link to
      http://klingonska.org/ on all pages, since there are links to all other
      pages on each page.

      Klingon" also probably better translated "Klingonskt uttal". :)
***** TODO Fix Markdown processing inside HTML elements + speedup
      Since we want the content of block level elements to be processed for
      Markdown (and Markdown doesn't do that), the content of all HTML block
      level elements should be extracted and individually processed.

      This would most likely speed up processing of Markdown source files with
      much HTML in them (like `tkw.txt`).
***** TODO Fix wonky <title>

***** TODO Automatic building of Table-of-Contents for longer articles
      `punct.html` could benefit from this (currently has quite an ugly <ul>
      with 'class="toc"' and some inline styles.

      Right now <!--TOC--> exists, but only works for KLO. It should be a
      standardized plugin kinda thing, which extracts info from markdown (or
      HTML) headlines.
***** TODO How to treat images wider than line width?
      `piqadpic.html` has some examples of this. Should images be resized to
      fit? It would be nice if they could come closer to the page margin than
      the ordinary text (when need be).

      It work decently already. Might be minor glitches on Opera or MSIE, just
      before word wrap applies. Low priority unless someone reports it faulty.

      Should make sure that the logo + title width, and the window width, actually
      reflects the real width on screen.

      Quirksmode has a nice article that might be illuminating on this subject.

***** TODO Javascript to alert user of updated parts

**** DONE [100%] Move site repo to GitHub
     CLOSED: [2012-06-20 Wed 15:31]
     This will save about 50M of diskspace on HCoop (where space is expensive),
     and future minifications and file compressions will work to save even more
     space. (As long as the git repo resided on HCoop all changes would make
     the site take up more diskspace, since the repo always grows with each
     commit).
***** DONE Update the old repo on GitHub

*** TODO Redesign <div class=gallery>
    `/songs/tahjaj_wo/` has got it right, but all other occurances need to be

*** TODO Linked images should have border highlight
    Maybe have a 2px transparent border on all linked images, and then changing
    color on hover? Problem now is that if an image is linked or not isn't very
    obvious. Esp. look at:

        http://klingonska.elektra/songs/tahjaj_wo/
        http://klingonska.elektra/akademien/logo/

    Both are using the "gallery" stylesheet, and are thus findable with:

        grep gallery **/*.html
*** TODO All <time> tags should include time zone
    Can "yyyy-mm-dd+zz:zz" be used? Or does the "+zz:zz" *require* that a time
    is used too (i.e. "yyyy-mm-ddThh:hh:ss+zz:zz")?

    Time zone data should be +01:00 or +02:00 depending on whether the time
    described was during daylight savings time or not.
*** TODO Linking Klingon phrases to English translation?
    Is there a microdata for this? Should one surround the phrases using <span>
    like this: <span><b lang="tlh">ya'Da ya'Da</b> <i class="transl">yadda
    yadda</i></span> ? Or maybe use some identifier, which is the same between
    the two phrases, but otherwise unique in the document, as an attribute
    value?

    Regardless: Can this be autogenerated from Markdown? (Without building
    *too* much intelligence into the Markdown->HTML processor...)

*** TODO Optimize PNG & JPEG images
    JPEGs can sometimes be radically shrunk by optimizing the hash tables in
    them. (Tools: `optipng` and `jpegoptim`)
*** TODO Disable word-wrap for naked Klingon affixes
    Use 'class="affix"', e.g. <b lang="tlh" class="affix">...</b>.

    Naked suffixes (e.g. {-moH}) (in e.g. dict/suffix.html) are sometimes
    wordwrapped, causing the hyphen to occur on a line of its own, and the
    suffix to come first on the following line. Like this:

        text text -
        moH text text

    That looks ugly. Such suffixes should have a class of "affix" and a
    stylesheet preventing wordwrap (i.e. "white-space: nowrap;").

    NOTE: Previously used Unicode character for non-breaking hyphen, but this
    is bad -- since that means one cannot search for them on a page using the
    ^F browser function.
*** TODO Replace <em>...</em> for translation with <i class="transl">...</i>
*** TODO Mark translated phrases with <i class="transl">...</i>
    What should be the markup? 'class="transl"'? No "lang" attribute
    generally be necessary, since it would (usually) be the same language as
    the surrounding text.
*** TODO Title page
**** Time limited displaying of new pages?
     Add some thing (javascript?) to indicate pages that have been recently
     updated This should maybe be displayed as "New!" for a week, and "New"
     (with less exclamation marks) for a month, or somesuch.

     This is remnant markup from an earlier such thought:

     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/ny.gif" width=31 height=14 alt="Ny" hspace=5></td>
     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/andrad.gif" width=54 height=14 alt="Ändrad" hspace=5></td>
     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/dot.gif" width=15 height=14 alt="*" hspace=5></td>
*** TODO CSS design

      area on the page below the page header (just the logo, left of the

      and all entries between them.)
***** DONE Browser 'back' / 'forward' should work
      CLOSED: [2013-03-02 Sat 00:36]
      I.e. when switching between tabs, the new page should be added to the

***** TODO Should prolly not use numbers words from dictionary

***** TODO Use only simplest word from the dictionary in analysis
      E.g. {bochmoHwI'} is both in dictionary and can be derived from rules.
      Probably requires field in dictionary with breakdown of gramatically
      complex words. E.g. the entry on {bochmoHwI'} should have a field
      specifying "boch(v)-moH(vs4)-wI'(vs9n)".

      The result of this should also be presented in the '# different' counter,
      as only the base {boch} should be use to increment the counter (the other,
      longer, word in the dictionary should not increase the counter).

**** TODO Highlight modes
     A selector to hide/display highlights. Modes that would be useful:
       * Part-of-speech (default)
       * Spellcheck mode (unknown highlighted, nothing else)
       * No highlight
**** TODO Hover over word should highlight all w/ same root
     If the word "bachwI'" is hovered on, then all words with that same root
     should be highlighted. ("bach", "bachqu'" etc.)
**** TODO Hover over word text should include translations
     Tell "Christoph Pichlmann <pichlmann-at-fredlarts.at>" when this is working.
**** TODO Words in legend by input field should be clickable
     They should enable/disable highlighting the words in the input field of
     their respective categories.
**** TODO Menu for each word in highlighted input text
     After analyzing, each word in the input field should get a menu. This
     should contain the same stuff the mouse-over text now contains + some extra
     stuff.

        Word:           qelchugh
        Part-of-speech  v
        Breakdown       qel(v)-chugh(vs9)

     User should also be able to manually choose the part-of-speech of ambiguous
     words by choosing it on this menu. Useful for those cases where the parser
     can't make up its mind.

     This should possibly not occur at once, but when flipping to the

     without modifying the score).
**** TODO Button for hiding/showing crossed out words
     There should be a selector, with which one can show/hide the words that are
     known. (If shown, they should be crossed out.)

     Words should not dissapear as one crosses them out, instead one should
     press the button again do remove the newly crossed out words.

    Michael Roney Jr.:

    This was discussed on the KLI mailing list in July of 2009 right after we
    gained {'at}, {bay}, {chay}, etc. I started the discussion, but Renee
    Scherer is the one who did the image based on everyone's input up to that
    point.

    The 'o'megh that you see in English isn't the one that was translated into
    Klingon. There are apparently several different ways to sing the song in

     When pressing the page logo user should be taken to the main index
     article, at the point of the entry of the article one came from. (The page
     metadata should probably look something like "up: ./#sbx-s7" and there be
     an "id=sbx-s7" in the main article.)

     When arriving at the main article, the entry in question should be

     Talking about food, no new word, but an interesting explanation:

     I asked if there were a word for "satisfied", "I'm full", i.e. you had 
     eaten enough.

     MO said no, but accepted {ghungHa'} for "not hungry any more". You 
     cannot use it though to say that you are not hungry, that should be 
     {ghungbe'} "not hungry". But if you are hungry first, then you eat 
     enough, then you can say {DaH jIghungHa'} "Now I am un-hungry." (="not 
     hungry any more")

     It also works with {'oj} the same way.

***** DONE Add Klingon Pocket Dictonary search to main page
      CLOSED: [2013-01-31 Thu 05:19]
      In Chrome, if a user searches from the main page search form, then the
      browser will thereafter automatically suggest using the search function
      in the address bar/omnibox (showing the text "Press <Tab> to search
      klingonska.org"), without the user having to navigate to the page first.

      This especially motivated since Google Analytics indicate that The
      Klingon Pocket Dictionary page has, by far, the the highest usage of all
      the pages on the website.
***** DONE Google Chrome should autodetect search engine(s)
      CLOSED: [2013-01-31 Thu 05:15]
      The following form is enough to enable the Chrome "Press [Tab] to search
      <hostname>" *if* (and only if) it resides on a hostname-only URL. (e.g.
      http://localhost/ works, but http://localhost/y/ does not work).

          <form method="get" action="">
              <input name="days" type="text" />
              <input type="submit" value="visa" />
          </form>

      This seems to work with added <input type="hidden"> fields as well..

      http://dict.klingonska.org/ or maybe http://paqhom.klingonska.org/ could
      be used for the paqhom dictionary.

      Mebbe add a http://klingonska.org/ (linked to google) for searches of the
      entire site.

      And http://canon.klingonska.org/ for http://klingonska.org/canon/ searches.

     Hey! The Apache thingy on HCoop already implements ETag. Maybe remove SHA1

     Rename 'SHA1' metadata tag 'ETag' instead (see
     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag).

     `dict.zdb` should be served by a CGI script, which should look at any
     'If-None-Match' HTTP header field sent by the client:

         If-None-Match: "5883445a723468ce3e2e4f872bc9bf84436ebab2"

     If the client sent an 'If-None-Match' that matches the current `dict.zdb`
     ETag, the CGI should send a '304 Not Modified' answer and no response
     body. In all other instances, the CGI should return the entire `dict.zdb`

**** TODO Add links to Lawrence Schoen's {DaHjaj Hol} episodes

     be presented as link to the show notes from the search engine.

     Could we store the base URL for the show in the dictionary metadata, and
     use paths relative to that?
**** [33%] Field/syntax changes
***** TODO Allow unconfirmed words without known source
      Unconfirmed words should be added, even if source is missing, with a

      Should words like these have an asterisk in their tlh: field + a warn:
      field? More?
***** TODO Add 'data:' value 'unconfirmed'

      for which we do not have a 100% certain translation.
***** TODO Remove period in "p." and "pp." abbreviations
      Page abbreviations should not have period in them, according to The
      Elements of Typographic Style.
***** TODO Use Unicode en-dash instead of '--' (?)
***** TODO Use Unicode "typographical" double quotes
      This would allow `check-dict` to do a better job, since there are
      different symbols for opening and closing quotes. It'll also look prettier. :)
***** TODO Use Unicode "typographical" single quotes & apostrophes
      Can't really check them properly (because of apostrophe looking the same
      as right single quote), but at least it'll look pretty.
***** TODO Use single ‹guillemets› to mark lookup words(?)
      Currently lesser/greater are used. This would require changes is all
      scripts that work with the dictionary. Is it worth it?
***** TODO Add 'lect:' field (for "slang", "regional" etc.)
      'regional', 'slang' etc. should have its own field, rather than be part
      of the 'en:' and 'sv:' fields.
***** TODO 'com:' should come before any 'cite:' fields
      When a 'com:' comment occurs it is usually more important than any
      'cite:' fields -- it can be a brief instruction to something (something
      gathered from several quotes, sometimes even with their separate quotes
      given as 'cite:' fields) or similar.
***** TODO 'tag:' field should come before 'com:'
      'tag:' field content is shorter, and more telling that the 'com:' field,
      so it should come earlier so as to allow user to faster get a 'feel' for
      the entry.
***** TODO 'id:' field should not allow 'TKD', 'KGT' etc.
      The 'id:' field should not contain anything that could be mistaken for
      source references, as that would be confusing.
***** TODO Systematize 'see:' field
      Right now it's kind of haphazardly implemented. It should be more
      systematic (and refer to the 'id:' of the of the linked-to entry + some
      extra human-readable info). Maybe like this?

          see: rqP ({quv} [1] (v) “be honored, be honorable”);
          see: AKU ({HoQ} (v) “be honored falsely, be falsely honorable”)
***** DONE Better, clearer source references
      CLOSED: [2013-12-07 Sat 11:02]
      Currently, second hand transcripts of sources (i.e. some unverified
      transcripts gotten through tlhingan-hol etc., as opposed to my own
      transcripts) are given as 'ref:', while the original source is given as
      'def:'.

      This sometimes get confusing: If there is a secondary source, i.e. a
      'ref:' which expands upon the original meaning of a word (gives a new
      English translation etc.) for which there is also a second hand
      transcript. (See {yIvbeH} for an example.)

      This could be solved by having all source references as filenames(?) --
      and second hand sources given within parentheses (thereby also removing
      the need for a separate 'file:' field). This way e.g. {yIvbeH} would look
      like this:

          tlh:    {yIvbeH} [.1]
          pos:    noun
          en:     <tunic>, «shirt»
          sv:     «tunika», «tröja»
          def:    1992-01-01-tkd
          ref:    2011-09-30-tnk (2011-11-02-email)
          tag:    1985; clothing
          id:     zqn

      The new source references are:

        * A source name never contains space.

        * Separated by semicolon. (Secondary sources too.) -- E.g. "XXX (AA;
          BB); YYY".

        * Case insensetive. -- However `check-dict` will require specific
          casing in order to have the references look neat, i.e. 'TKD' must be
          all upper, the word 'Email' must capitalised etc.

        * Does not contain file path or extension.

        * Leading date is optional (Unless required for disambiguation.) --
          However `check-dict` will require that dates *not* be present where
          they are not required.

        * Secondary sources may be specified in parentheses. (A secondary
          source is a different source, where a transcript of the primary
          source have been published (whole or in part). Secondary sources are
          especially important where the primary source can be difficult to
          find or obtain.)

          tlh:    {yIvbeH} [.1]
          pos:    noun
          en:     <tunic>, «shirt»
          sv:     «tunika», «tröja»
          def:    TKD
          ref:    TNK (2011-11-02-Email)

      required.
***** DONE Add 'id:' field with (random) unique word ID number
      CLOSED: [2012-11-21 Wed 14:59]
      This would be useful, since programs (like the Glossary Extractor page)
      could use this to keep track of words, even if dictionary is updated.
      (I.e. if the internal state makes use of the unique ID, then the
      dictionary can be refetche/reloaded, and any updated entries will still
      retain their ID.)

      ID wouldn't have to be very large (since the dictionary is less than 3000
      thousand words). A three digit base 58 encoded value should suffice
      (giving 195 112 possible interpretations), and have plenty of room to
      spare.

      Base 58 -- also used for bitcoin addresses -- uses upper + lower case
      letters + digits, except for 0 (zero), O (capital "o"), I (capital "i")
      and l (lower case "l"). Eliminating characters that are very similar in
      shape makes it easy to transcribe without getting it wrong.

      A small Perl program to generate random IDs. (These will, of course, have
      to be checked for uniqueness in the dictionary.)

          #!/usr/bin/perl -w
          use 5.10.0;
          use strict;
          my @x = grep(!/[0OIl]/, "a".."z", "A".."Z", 0..9);

***** TODO Better listing of sources is 'en:' and 'sv:' fields
      Specificly, since the 'en' and 'sv' fields are created from different
      sources, it would be desireble to list exactly which part of this fields
      that come from what source. -- Maybe one should rework the syntax of these
      fields?

      Perhaps something like this?

          tlh: {'ay'}
          en: "section" [TKD]; "part", "piece", "component" [KGT]

      or

          tlh: {'ay'}
          en: <section> [TKD]; <part>, <piece>, <component> [KGT]; «chapter»

      Where "chapter" would then be a synonym (without support in canon).

      Or maybe the following would be better?

          tlh: {HuH}
          en: bile, slime, gall
          ref: bile; gall; slime
          sv:  galla; slem

          whatever came to their mind. Okrand answered, "Maltz and I really
          liked the scroll. (He told me the word for scroll was {Qumran}, by
          the way.) Thanks to everyone who wrote messages or drew pictures. We
          really appreciate all of the nice thoughts." (Okrand's email to
          Lieven, 6/03/2013)

      After the inevitable questions, Okrand wrote Lieven again (6/08/2013):

          Maltz was so pleased with the scroll/long letter that you sent, he
          volunteered the word {Qumran} and I didn't think to ask him how a
          {Qumran} differed from a {tetlh}. But I've asked him now. While
          {tetlh} can refer to a scroll, it can also refer to any- thing rolled
          up scroll-like (like toilet paper). The meaning of {tetlh}, over
          time, got extended to refer not only to the scroll/roll, but the
          contents of what may be written on a scroll and from there to refer
          to the sort of thing that may be traditionally written on a scroll,
          such as a "list" of things. So, even if not written on a scroll, a
          shopping list could be a {tetlh}. So could a ship's manifest. A
          {Qumran}, on the other hand, is only a scroll. And it has
          connotations of something important or sacred or ancient, though a
          {Qumran} need not be all three of those things. When a scroll is a
          part of a cere- mony of some kind, it's typically referred to as a
          {Qumran}, not a {tetlh}, even though it is a {tetlh}, so if you
          called it that, you wouldn't be wrong, but it might sound
          inappropriate. ... In short - any {Qumran} is a {tetlh}, but every
          {tetlh} is not a {Qumran}.

          PUN: "The Dead Sea scrolls from Qumran!"

      KGT 151: ... doctors spend a great deal of their time tending to
      critically wounded patients and relatively little time performing routine
      examinations or practicing preventive medicine.

      Despite the considerable sophistication of Klingon technology,
      significant gaps exist in Klingon medical science, in part due to
      cultural biases that seriously injured warriors should be left to die or
      to carry out the *Hegh'bat* rather than live in shame and humiliation.

      De' Daj vItu'pu'!

      Visar sig att man kan använda ordet «rav» ("golv") som "minimum", ungefär
      som man använder «'aqroS» ("undersidan av överdelen") för "maximum". Det
      används på BoP-affischen i meningen «Hung buv rav: patlh Hut», som
      översätts som "Classified Level 9 and Above" men bokstavligen betyder
      "säkerhetsklassifikationsgolv: nivå 9". Kan vara värt att lägga till i
      {tlhIngan Hol mu'ghomlIj mach}.

       /Okay, here it comes. Besides of the students at the qepHom in
       Saarbrücken, you are the first to read this. Note for the newbies: This
       is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the creator of the
       Klingon Language:/

       Finally, someone last year asked for the word for "picture." At first,
       Maltz wondered why {nagh beQ} wasn't good enough. But then he thought
       about it some more and said that another word, {mIllogh}, could be used
       for any sort of depiction, including drawings, photographs, cartoons,
       icons on 21st-century computers, and so on.

       /Here's another word revealed at the qepHom in Saarbrücken. Note for the
       newbies: This is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the
       creator of the Klingon Language:/

       Maltz first said that Klingons don't have pillows and he wondered why
       anyone would want one. But he's seen them (somewhere) and knows what
       they are. So when pushed -- "If you have to call it something, what
       would you call it?" -- he said {ngogh tun}. A {ngogh} is a "block" or
       "lump" or "brick." He said he's seen humans eating {yuch ngoghmey} and
       found that strange. I'm not sure what form he'd prefer his {yuch} to be.

       He thought more about it and said maybe another way to say "pillow" was
       {QongDaq buq} "bed pouch," but he said that could also apply to a
       sleeping bag. Perhaps a sleeping bag is {QongDaq buq'a'} and a pillow is
       {QongDaq buqHom}. The word {buq} could be "bag, sack, pouch" or even
       "pocket." When clarity is needed, one could say, for example, {yopwaH
       buq} "pants pouch" or {wep buq} "coat pouch" for "pants pocket" or "coat
       pocket," but when the context is clear, {buq} alone would suffice for
       "pocket."

     (Reported via email on Monday March 12, 2012.)

     {toqvIr} is called a "Tokvirian skink" in the body of KGT (p. 88) but a
     "Tokvarian skink" (-a- rather than -i-) in the dictionary part.

     You have a note to this effect ("Tokvarian skink [[Tokvarian:=Tokvirian]]") in
     the K-E portion of canon/1997-11-01-kgt.txt) but you have "Tokvirian
     skink" with -i- in the E-K portion, even though my KGT has "Tokvarian"
     there, too. ("My KGT" = First Pocket Books trade paperback printing
     September 1997, ISBN 0-671-00995-8, in case editions vary.)

     The word was *{Soq}.

     It was a word which seemed to be a synonym to {lo'} or something. The word
     occured in some HolQeD issue, and turned out to be mistranscribed when I
     checked against the actual trading card.

     It should be included in the dictionary, with 'data: non-canon', so others
     won't include it in their dictionaries.
*** Klingon Pocket Dictionary (paper version)
**** English--Klingon part
***** TODO Change layout in English--Klingon part
      It should look something like this:

      (Typographic key: *sans serif* /italic/ {bold})

          *worthless*  /v/  {lo'laHbe'} be ~
          *worthless*  /v/  be ~ {lo'laHbe'}

          *friend* /n/ close male ~ of a male
            {maqoch} buddy, pal [KGT]
          *buddy* /n/ {maqoch} pal, close male
            friend of a male
          *close male friend of a male* /n/
            {maqoch} buddy, pal

          *fresh* /v/ be ~ {baQ} be just picked
            (fruit, vegetable)
          *ceiling* /n/ {pa' beb} (of a room on
            the top story of a structure)
          *pa' beb* /n/ ceiling (of a room on the
            top story of a structure) [News
            1998-12-07; HQ8:3 p.2]

       Currently, if you look up a word like "wrong", you'll find:

           *wrong* /v/ {muj} be ~

       Which makes it very easy to miss that fact the word is adjectival in
       nature. I propose that this should instead be represented as:

           *wrong* /v/ be ~ {muj}

       Let's take a look at the word defined as "<buddy>, <pal>, <close male
       <friend>> of a male (n)" in the database below. Currently you can find
       the entries:

           *buddy* /n/ {maqoch} pal, close male
             friend of a male
           *close male friend* /n/ {maqoch} buddy,
             pal, ~ of a male
           *friend* /n/ {maqoch} buddy, pal, close
             male ~ of a male
           *pal* /n/ {maqoch} buddy, close male
             friend of a male

       But I think this should instead be represented as:

           *buddy* /n/ {maqoch} pal, close male
             friend of a male
           *close male friend* /n/ ~ of a male
             {maqoch} buddy, pal
           *friend* /n/ close male ~ of a male
             {maqoch} buddy, pal
           *pal* /n/ {maqoch} buddy, close male
             friend of a male

       The idea is that the definition (but not the entire description, since
       we want to keep it short) from which the lookup entry was taken should
       be presented to the reader before the Klingon word, so that the reader
       have as much context as possible to relate the word to.

         {jagmoH} "cause to be bold" ("embolden")

    For instance S8 with the title:

    In the Klingon text it is called: {batleH}

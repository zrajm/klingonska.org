Introduction

Until recently, the Klingon Empire and the United
Federation of Planets had been at peace for some
eighty years and allies for a quarter century. During that
time, each society had come to know the other in ways nei-
ther could have imagined possible during the previous sev-
enty or so years of antagonism. The Federation increased
this knowledge of the Empire's history, politics, economics,
and to a lesser degree, language and traditions relatively
early on. This led to a thriving economic relationship as
well as unexpected cultural enrichment. All this, however,
may have come to an end as a result of the Klingon with-
drawal from the Khitomer Accords, the peace treaty [[p.vi]]
between the Empire and the Federation, following
Federation opposition to the Klingon invasion of the
Cardassian Union.
     Before the era of peace, most citizens of the Federation
considered Klingons to be warlike, hostile, savage, primi-
tive, rude, close minded, threatening, aggressive, ruthless,
demanding temperamental, brutal, and generally rather
unpleasant. As Captain James T. Kirk once put it, "They're
animals." Though increased interaction with the Klingons
did not entirely disprove any of these characterizations, it
did make it obvious that such descriptive terms are incom-
plete. Klingons, it was seen, are efficient, loyal, cunning,
strong, proud, and, above all, honorable. Though some
progress has been made, getting a firm grasp on the true
nature of the Klingons---their basic character traits, their
real values and guiding principles---remains elusive. The
fact that the Klingon Empire's response to the political sit-
uation in the Cardassian Union took the Federation by sur-
prise has only underscored the lack of real understanding.
     In order to find out more about the Klingons, some in
the Federation have insisted that it is necessary to get
inside the Klingon mind: to see what Klingons believe, how
they think, how they react naturally to situations.
Federation social scientists used to argue that a lack of
such knowledge would be a hindrance to making the
alliance more solid, and inevitably lead to miscommunica-
tion followed by outbreaks of discord and distrust. Their
predictions proved accurate.
     With the goal of reestablishing peace with the
Empire---or at least of being able to predict what the
Klingons might do next---the Federation Scientific
Research Council has launched an investigatory project to
catalog Klingon beliefs about life and the universe. This is
intended to supplement the Klingon cultural database that
has been available for some time and has been used in con- [[p.vii]]
junction with various Federation missions. As extensive as
that database is, it often lacks the Klingons' own perspec-
tive on their culture. Given the current political situation,
it is difficult to ask Klingons questions, so the procedure
has been to let Klingon speak for themselves---to listen to
comments they have made to justify position or to explain
actions. By examining the Klingons' own words, their moral
and ethical values should became apparent. This compila-
tion is the project's initial report, bringing together state-
ments that, directly or indirectly, illustrate Klingon virtues.
     A "virtue" is a particularly valued quality or a form of
behavior that exemplifies moral correctness, as defined by
a society. Those members of Starfleet who have had the
most contact with the Empire have noted that, in Captain
Jean-Luc Picard's words, "The Klingons are efficient, loyal
to their beliefs, and are regulated by a strict code of
ethics." Indeed, the Klingon word "{ghob}" may be trans-
lated as "ethics or virtue," linguistic evidence that the
concept is not unknown or never discussed among the
Klingons themselves. It is probably significant that the
Klingon word for "do battle," or "wage war" is likewise
"{ghob}".
     Though some, perhaps many, of a society's virtues are
represented is its legal codes, a virtue is not a law. A vio-
lation of a virtue need not carry with it any legal sanction.
A virtue does not even have to be followed all the time to
still be considered a virtue. What is important is that mem-
bers of the society agree that the virtue represents what
<should> be done, even if it is not done. When a virtue is
ignored, all recognize the transgression, even if there are
no immediate consequences.
     A society's values are often encapsulated in its reper-
toire of proverbs or maxims, common statements of funda-
mental truths that are applicable to may situations. Such
expressions are well known by the member of the society. [[p.viii]]
They are often short and are frequently (some might say too
frequently) uttered. They give advice generally accepted to
be worth heeding. The meaning of many proverbs is rea-
sonably straightforward, such as the old Federation saw
"Out of sight, out of mind," which suggests that anything or
anyone not present is apt to be forgotten. In other cases, the
meaning is metaphorical. "Too many cooks spoil the
broth," for example, usually has nothing to do with prepar-
ing soup. Such phrases make reference to items or activi-
ties familiar in the culture---in this case, cooking---in
order to make more general points. An interesting feature
of proverbs is that, to some extent, they may contradict one
another.. In addition to "Out of sight, out of mind," one
hears "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" (anything or
anyone not present is thought about more positively, if not
more frequently). Both proverbs are valid; a complex soci-
ety may have multiple points of view.
     Other phrases illustrating a society's values are not so
common, not necessarily known by the population at large.
Perhaps they are found in literary works known only to a
certain subgroup. They may be related to a certain occu-
pation or be heard in only one locality. Nonetheless, they
still embody certain tenets shared by the society as a
whole.
     One problem that often arises is where to find these
various statements. Simply asking someone to recite a list
of proverbs is of limited utility; they are far better under-
stood if heard in context, springing forth naturally in a par-
ticular situation. For Klingon utterances there is, fortu-
nately, a huge databank that can be consulted for just such
occurrences. For years, Starfleet has been keeping ships' and
personal logs on file. The Research Council has been
granted access to these archives for purposes of this study.
Contained in these logs are numerous comments actually
made by or attributed to Klingons encountered during var- [[p.ix]]
ious missions, including a large number uttered by the first
Klingon to become a Starfleet officer, Lieutenant
Commander Worf. In addition, the Council, as part of its
ongoing linguistic research, has been collecting numerous
Klingon phrases, many of which fall into the categories
useful for the current study.
     In this report, those sayings (or references to sayings)
found in the Starfleet archives are so noted, identified by
the nicknames Starfleet has given to various missions. An
explanation of these identifications is found at the end of
this report. Sayings without such annotations are taken
from the linguistic studies. All phrases are given in both
Federation Standard and Klingon, transcribed in the
romanization system most commonly used in the
Federation today. Even though many of these sayings were
first recorded in Federation Standard, they tend to have
fixed phrasings in Klingon. To determine what they are,
Klingons have been consulted in each case, though this
has not always been easy. By the same token, some of the
sayings are not new to the Federation and have come to
have standardized translations. Though commonly heard
(and used in this report), these translations are not always
the most revealing ones. For example "{Dujeychugh jagh
nIv yItuHQo'}" is translated, "There is nothing shameful
in falling before a superior enemy"---a simple statement. A
more literal translation, however, is "If a superior enemy
defeats you, don't be ashamed," a direct command. Indeed,
many Klingon proverbs are commands, a telling fact in its
own right. As appropriate, additional notes about usage,
background, or translation are provided for many phrases,
though some are left to stand on their own.
     This report is, of course, the result of a collaborative
effort. A full team of researchers devoted a great deal of
time to going through mission reports, conducting ancillary
investigations, translating, and so on. Any benefit gained [[p.x]]
from this report is due to their hard work. Any errors or
misinterpretations are the author's.
     It is hoped that this report, which is really a collection
of traditions and beliefs and virtues captured in speech,
will make a contribution towards the appreciation of
Klingon identity and pride and will help lead to the recon-
ciliation of the two governments. {Qapla'} [[p.1]]

}} [[p.3]]


We are Klingons!

{tlhIngan maH!}

This is the strongest expression of joy among Klingons and
probably the most frequently heard Klingon phrase. It is
used not only in the throes of battle but on any other joy-
ous occasion as well. When Kahless the Unforgettable, who
united the Klingon Empire, was cloned years later, the
replica retained the ancient Klingon attitudes. He said to
Gowron, the leader of the Klingon High Council, "You have
no joy, Gowron. Is your heart so filled with distrust and sus-
picion that you have forgotten what it is to be truly
Klingon?"

Klingons are born, live as warriors, then die.

{bogh tlhInganpu', SuvwI'pu' moj, Hegh.}


Klingons are born to fight and conquer.

{SuvmeH 'ej charghmeH bogh tlhInganpu'.}

These two maxims express the belief that fighting and win-
ning define a Klingon's very being; everything else in life
is secondary, if not superfluous. Unless they are engaged in
battle or preparing for battle, Klingons become rather can-
tankerous (though, to those unfamiliar with Klingons, this
might not be noticeable). As a result, Klingons are likely
to, at the slightest provocation, instigate a battle of some
sort
     Lieutenant Commander Worf is well aware of the
Klingon predilection reflected in these two sayings.
Though raised among humans, he has always prided him-
self on his knowledge of Klingon history and culture. He
observed that a potentially dangerous situation involving
the Dominion and the Cardassians, which the Klingons
viewed as a threat, "has given my people an excuse to do
what they were born to do: to fight and to conquer."

{The son of Mogh confronts his own "lack of faith"

When threatened, fight.

{DabuQlu'DI' yISuv.}

This is one of many common exhortations that encourage
Klingons to respond to situations appropriately.
     After the <Enterprise>'s initial encounter with the entity
Q, Worf gave voice to this attitude. He advised Captain
Jean-Luc Picard that "our only choice is to fight." If we
Klingons understand anything, it is the meaning of that
kind of talk.

<The Next Generation: Encounter at Farpoint>


We fight to enrich the spirit.

{qa' wIje'meH maSuv.}

A more literal translation of this Klingon phrase is "We
fight in order to feed the spirit," focusing more on the role
of the giver of enrichment (the Klingon) than that of the
recipient (the spirit). For Klingons, the spirit is something
that must be cared for actively. As the clone of Kahless
pointed out, fighting is more than a physical activity: "We
do not fight merely to spill blood, but to enrich the spirit."
Interestingly, because of the homophony of the Klingon
words for "feed" and "buy," both "{je'}," the phrase could
also be translated as "We fight in order to buy the spirit."
If this is not mere coincidence, then, perhaps, to the
Klingon way of thinking, while one is alive, one must sac-
rifice or give up something (the way one uses credits or lat-
inum when making a purchase) in order to ensure that the
spirit is one's own.

<The Next Generation: Rightful Heir> [[p.8]]


If you are sad, act!

{bI'IQchugh yIvang!}

This exhortation is actually ambiguous, but both interpre-
tations give insight into the Klingon way of thinking. The
phrase could be advising one to take specific action to
overcome sadness---that is, figure out exactly what the
problem is and do something about it. On the other hand,
for a Klingon, activity and vigor are associated with a sense
of elation, while unhappiness is often connected to passiv-
ity or even laziness, character traits disdained by Klingons.
Thus, the advice could be simply to do anything at all.


Hit them hard and hit them fast.

{tIqIpqu' 'ej nom tIqIp.}

When the <Enterprise> was held in the grip of a Ferengi force
field, Worf offered this advice to Captain Picard as a way to
deal with the opponent. Once again, the importance of tak-
ing action, of not being passive or reticent, may be
observed in the suggestion.

<The Next Generation: The Last Outpost> [[p.9]]


Klingons do not procrastinate.

{lumbe' tlhInganpu'.}

Not only do Klingon see the virtue of taking action, they
prefer to take action right away. From the Klingon point of
view, although planning and organizing are appropriate,
there is no reason not to proceed with any mission or task
once the goal is established.

<The Next Generation: Liaisons>


If it's in your way, knock it down.

{Dubotchugh yIpummoH.}

Though split into two individuals---one fully Klingon, one
fully human---by a Vidiian scientist, the human B'Elanna
Torres still retained her Klingon knowledge, if not her
Klingon impulses. She cited this adage---again illustrating
the Klingon penchant for action and for taking control---
when she commented on the behavior of her Klingon self.

<Voyager: Faces> [[p.10]]

{Gowron (Robert O'Reilly) clashes with his friend over
how to survive as Klingons.}

}} [[p.11]]


To survive, we must expand.

{mataHmeH maSachnIS.}

This has long been a rallying cry among Klingons. When
Commander Kang and a group of stranded Klingons forced
James T. Kirk into letting them board the <Enterprise> after
their own ship had been destroyed, the Federation crew
and the Klingons became engaged in a series of bloody
skirmishes, with neither side able to achieve victory.
Captain Kirk realized that an alien life form aboard the
ship was controlling them, causing them to continue the
fighting. The only way to thwart this entity was to work
together with the Klingons and stop the hostilities. Kang's
science officer and wife, Mara, did not think it would be
easy to convince him to cooperate, since combat is the
Klingon way. "We have always fought," she said. "We must
... We must push outward if we are to survive."
     Years later, the idea is still present in the Klingon con-
sciousness. Worf one noted that many Klingons feel "the
Empire must expand to survive." The word for "survive,"
"{taH}," can also be translated "continue, endure, go on."

Klingons are a proud race, and we intend
to go on being proud.

{Hem tlhIngan Segh 'ej maHemtaH
'e' wIHech.}

The first formal meeting between the Klingon Empire and
the United Federation of Planets, which eventually result-
ed in their alliance, was held on Khitomer, a planet near
the Klingon-Romulan border. Representing the Empire
was Azetbur, who was appointed to lead the Klingon High
Council after her father, Chancellor Gorkon, was assassi-
nated by a coalition of those opposed to the impending
peace. In her address to the conference, Azetbur altered
this saying slightly when she insisted that the treaty in no
way diminished the stature of the Klingon Empire: "We are
a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on
being proud."
     Years later, as the Federation-Klingon alliance began
to fall apart, Klingon leader Gowron still adhered to this
virtue. When he discovered that his rationale for moving
against the Federation was based on misinformation, he
held his ground, maintaining Klingon pride by coming up
with a new justification for his aggression. That the
Dominion had not taken over the Cardassian government
"is of no consequence," Gowron said. "All that matters is
that the Alpha Quadrant will be safer with the Klingon
Empire in control of Cardassia."

Great deeds, great songs.

{ta'mey Dun, bommey Dun.}

Though the subtleties of Klingon music are not often
appreciated by non-Klingons, songs are a very important
part of Klingon culture, for it is through song that much
history---both political and personal---is preserved. Great
accomplishments are commonly immortalized in song, as
are Klingon attitudes. Because songs are repeated, the
same way proverbs are repeated, they help to preserve tra-
dition as well as to teach the young. The singing of a song
typically marks an occasion as momentous. Appropriately,
Gowron tried to get Worf to join his cause by referring to
this element of Klingon culture: "We will do great deeds in
the coming days, deeds worthy of song." Klingons are also
well known for their extensive collection of drinking songs.

The memory of you sings in my blood.

{bomDI' 'IwwIj qaqaw.}

This is a line excerpted from a Klingon poem. Poetry plays
a prominent role in Klingon mating behavior. The female
typically roars, throws heavy objects, and claws at her part-
ner. The male reads love poetry and, as Worf put it, "ducks
a lot." This particular line is interesting because it rein-
forces the  importance of song as a memory-triggering
device. The literal, though less poetic, translation of the
line is "When my blood sings, I remember you."
Presumably the blood's song concerns the beloved individ-
ual.

Choose to fight, not negotiate.

{bISuv 'e' yIwIv; bISutlh 'e' yIwIvQo'.}


If you must negotiate, watch
your enemy's eyes.

{bISutlhnIS jaghlI' mInDu' tIbej.}

While negotiation is not the Klingon's first choice of an
approach to settling differences, it is not to be ruled out
altogether. Worf himself has articulated the ideas embod-
ied in both of these proverbs. Regarding the search for
diplomatic solutions, he once remarked, "This is hopeless,
fighting would be preferable." On the other hand, when
talk is called for, one must not rely on words alone: "I pre-
fer to negotiate eye to eye with my enemy."

Brute strength is not the most important
asset in a fight.

{Suvlu'taHvIS yapbe' HoS neH.}

As vital as musculature and weaponry are in winning bat-
tles or maintaining control, other qualities are equally if
not more important. The unstated significance of this
maxim is that intelligence and judgment play key roles in
any confrontation.
     When Worf learned that his father, who had been killed
by Romulans in the Khitomer massacre, was later falsely
accused of treason, he decided to exercise his responsibil-
ity as a son and appear before the Klingon High Council
either to clear his father's name or to be punished for his
crimes. According to Klingon custom, even though Worf
was the one bringing the challenge, he was considered the
accused since he would bear the punishment if the accu-
sations against his father stood. During the course of the
proceedings he was not permitted to participate in any
fights himself, but instead was defended by an aide
("{cha'DIch}," literally, "second").
     After Kurn, Worf's younger brother and first
{cha'DIch}, was wounded, Worf asked Captain Picard to be
his {cha'DIch}. Though, as Picard pointed out, stronger
men were available, Worf preferred the captain, undoubt-
edly because of his shrewdness and loyalty. Such qualities
are valued more than physical prowess alone. [[p.22]]

{His understanding of Klingon politics gives Worf the

Real power is in the heart.

{tIqDaq HoSna' tu'lu'.}

In this phrase, the heart stands for one's spirit or princi-
ples. One's ability to exert influence over others comes
from having a strong sense of morality, not merely from the
ability to dominate by force.
     When the clone of Kahless was named emperor, the
Klingon cleric Koroth objected that it would be meaning-
less since all power would still remain with the Klingon
High Council. Worf used this adage to point out that
Kahless's lack of political authority was not as important as
his honor and virtue, which would make him an effective
leader of his people.

<The Next Generation: Rightful Heir> [[p.24]]

There is nothing shameful in falling
before a superior enemy.

{Dujeychugh jagh nIv yItuHQo'.}

<The Next Generation: The Last Outpost>


There is no honor in attacking the weak.

{pujwI' HIvlu'chugh quvbe'lu'.}

Though sometimes difficult to discern, it would appear that
Klingons do have a sense of fair play. Worf quoted this
aphorism to his son, Alexander, who had just bullied a
group of children. Though phrased in presumably military
terms, the ethic expressed by the saying runs throughout
Klingon society.

<The Next Generation: Reunion> [[p.25]]


When in doubt, surprise them.

{bISovbejbe'DI' tImer.}

This offering of wisdom is commonly understood as a sug-
gested battle strategy. "When you are uncertain about what
to do in a confrontation, "it advises, "choose the course of
action your opponent is least likely to be anticipating."
This complements the following cited tenet. If one trusts
one's instincts, even when full knowledge is lacking, one
will be able to make a decision, pursue a course of action,
and, therefore, catch one's opponent off guard. Once, when
the <Enterprise> entered a black void and nothing seemed to
work properly, Worf suggested adhering to this Klingon
tactic as Commander William Riker and he prepared to
beam onto the <U.S.S. Yamato>, just in case the Federation
vessel was not as deserted as it appeared to be.

Trust your instincts.

{DujlIj yIvoq.}

Klingon Commander Kruge invoked this principle when,
after attacking the <Enterprise>, he concluded that the
Federation starship may have suffered substantial damage.
Though there was no concrete evidence of this, he said "I
trust my instincts."
     Similarly, Klingon renegades Korris and Konmel,
beamed aboard the <Enterprise> just before their own (stolen)
ship exploded, appealed to this notion when they tried to
lure Worf to reject the Klingon-Federation alliance and
join them. "Our instinct will lead us," said Korris.
"Instincts that have not been dulled by living among 'civi-
lized' men," Konmel added, by way of clarification.
     The Klingon word for instincts is "{Duj}," and it is
grammatically correct to treat it as singular (a bundle or
collection of instincts) or plural (individual instincts).
"{Duj}" also means "ship" or "vessel," so a possible inter-
pretation of the aphorism is "trust your ship." In this con-
text, a vessel could symbolize oneself. To a Klingon, this
reveals a deep truth.

There are no old warriors.

{SuvwI'pu' qan tu'lu'be'.}

This does not mean that all warriors are young at heart. It
is quite literal. Traditionally, if a captain becomes weak
and incapable of serving, he is assassinated by his first
officer. A similar arrangement is in effect for officers of
lower rank. As Worf put it, "The Klingon system has oper-
ated successfully for centuries."

Listen to the voice of your blood.

{'IwlIj ghogh yIQoy.}

For Klingons, blood is more than just one of a number of
red-pink bodily fluids. It represents the animating force of
life itself, that which controls basic temperament and char-
acter. It is strength. It is the commander, making the deci-
sions and giving the orders. With effort, its influence can
be repressed, but never entirely ignored. For a warrior to
get in touch with himself, to lead a truly effective life, he
must pay attention to, or listen to, what his blood has to
say. Though Konmel used the common Federation Stan-
dard translation when he tried to get Worf to join him, the
Klingon version of this frequently heard exhortation is a
bit more pointed. The verb "{Qoy}" means "hear," not just
"listen." One must actually perceive and understand that
which is being said.

<The Next Generation: Heart of Glory> [[p.32]]


A warrior's blood boils before the fire is hot.

{tujpa' qul pub SuvwI' 'Iw.}

This proverb suggests that it is better to take the initiative
that to simply react to situations. Blood, the controller,
does not need an external influence in order to heat up; one
need not draw strength from the outside.
     Perhaps because of increased association with the
Federation, or perhaps simply as a result of the progression
of time, the number of venues available to Klingons to act
on their basic genetic need for battle and confrontation---
their boiling blood---has diminished. Whereas once
Klingon warriors would use the slightest provocation as
justification for a fight, today, more so than in the past, the
strengths and skills of the warrior are often demonstrated
ritualistically. Mock battle and tournaments are staged,
such as the competition on Forcas III, in which Klingons
prove their skills at wielding the {bat'telh}, the traditional [[{bat'telh}:=bat'telh]]
sword. [[p.33]]


In space, all warriors are cold warriors.

{loghDaq Suvrupbogh SuvwI'pu'
chaH Hoch SuvwI'pu''e'.}

Since this expression refers to being in space ({loghDaq}),
it is either a relatively new saying or else it is an updated
version of an older one. There is no way to know for sure.
Klingon have been capable of interplanetary travel for at
least 200 standard years, enough time for many new phras-
es to work their way into common usage. Clearly, it refers
to warriors being in an environment far away from govern-
mental or bureaucratic fetters, a setting where warriors are
free to be just warriors and not worry about political con-
sequences. Without knowing more about ancient Klingon
history, what, if anything, might have predated "{loghDaq}"
in the expression cannot be determined. Perhaps it was a
term referring to the open seas, as the Klingons have a his-
tory of naval warfare. The Klingon words translated "cold
warriors" are "{Suvrupbogh SuvwI'pu'}," literally, "war-
riors who are ready to fight."

<Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country> [[p.34]]


Blood and water don't mix.

{tay'taHbe' 'Iw bIQ je.}

Just as "blood" is used figuratively to refer to power,
"water" carries the opposite and negative connotation of
lack of control. Strength cannot coexists with weakness
within an individual or a successful society. Klingon sci-
entist J'Ddan used "water" in this way when criticizing the
influence the Federation had on the Empire: "The blood of
all Klingons has become water."

<The Next Generation: The Drumhead>


One is always of his tribe.

{reH tay' ghot tuqDaj je.}

This is an old Klingon adage that years ago was rendered
into Federation standard in the form cited, using the word [[standard:=Standard]]
"tribe" for "{tuq}," an ancestral grouping now usually trans-
lated as "house." The literal meaning of the Klingon
phrase is "A person and his house are always together."
Though cast in terms of family, the expression can apply to
friendship as well. The basic idea conveyed is that no mat-
ter what happens and no matter where one may go, one
remains attached to family and significant friends. [[p.35]]


Drinking fake ale is better
than drinking water.

{tlhutlhmeH HIq ngeb qaq law'
bIQ qaq puS.}

"Fake ale" is a term used to refer to a rather nonpotent ale,
perhaps akin to "near beer." Again, the negative image of
water---weakness---emerges. Anything is better than
water; the less waterlike, the better. Therefore, it is not
surprising that Worf commented that the prune juice
served to him by Guinan is "a warrior's drink." It is not at
all watery. The negative associations with water might also
be seen when Worf remarked to Counselor Deanna Troi,
"Swimming is too much like bathing."

A warrior does not let a friend face danger alone.

{nIteb Qob qaD jup 'e' chaw'be' SuvwI'.}

The central issue addressed in this adage is loyalty. When
Soren, a J'naii with whom Commander Riker fell in love,
was arrested for exhibiting gender-specific feelings, a
crime among the J'naii, Riker decided to act on his own
and rescue her before she was forced to undergo therapy
that would remove these feelings. Worf offered to help his
friend, citing this Klingon virtue as his rationale. This was
not the first time Worf exhibited this type of behavior.
Before Riker boarded the <Pagh>, a Klingon ship on which
he served in an officer exchange program, Wolf gave him
an emergency transponder. The commander could the be
located and beamed back if necessary. Though Worf said it
was simply a security precaution, both Riker and he knew
it was an expression of friendship and loyalty. Worf would
not permit Riker to face the potential danger alone.
     Even though this Klingon character trait might be con-
sidered an admirable one, even by non-Klingons, it might
not be all that selfless. If Riker had accepted the captain-
cy of the <Ares>, Worf would have joined him on that ship.
The Klingon pointed out that it could have been a "dan-
gerous mission" with "the potential for combat". The
underlying motivation for such altruism, it would appear, is
that Klingons do not want to be left out if there is even the
slightest possibility that there will be a battle.

<The Next Generation: The Outcast>

<The Next Generation: A Matter of Honor>

<The Next Generation: The Icarus Factor> [[p.38]]


When a warrior goes to battle, he does
not abandon his friends.

{may'Daq jaHDI' SuvwI' juppu'Daj lonbe'.}

This might be a stronger statement about friendship and
loyalty that the preceding adage, for here the admired
virtue is to make sure that friends have the opportunity to
participate in battle.
     Three Klingon captains---Kang, Koloth, and Kor---
were one ordered to stop a series of raids on Klingon
colonies by a group of depredators led by an albino.
Although their mission was successful, the albino escaped,
promising to take revenge on the firstborn of each of the
three captains. Hi did so by infecting the Klingon children
with a fatal genetic virus. One of the children was the god-
son of Curzon Dax, a Federation diplomat. Dax was
admired by the child's father, Kang---who had once had an
encounter with Captain James T. Kirk---for his diplomatic
accomplishments and his understanding of Klingon nature.
The three Klingon captains, along with Curzon Dax, took a
blood oath to find the albino and avenge the deaths of the
children.
     Curzon Dax was a Trill, a joined species consisting of a
humanoid host and a symbiont that resides within the host.
When Curzon, the trill host, was near death, the symbiont
Dax was transplanted. The new host, Jadzia Dax, though
considered another person, retains all of the memories of
Curzon, as well as of previous joinings.
     When the whereabouts of the albino were finally dis-
covered, the three Klingon captains came together on
space station Deep Space 9 to prepare to exact revenge.

ly not bound by Curzon's oath, wanted to honor it. Kang
withheld his approval until Jadzia, drawing on Curzon's
knowledge of Klingon ways, including the maxim cited
here, reminded him, "No Klingon warrior would leave a
comrade behind while he goes off to battle."

Klingons do not faint.

{vulchoHbe' tlhInganpu'.}


Klingons do not get sick.

{ropchoHbe' tlhInganpu'.}


Klingons do not lie in bed.

{QongDaqDaq Qotbe' tlhInganpu'.}


Although these phrases are hyperbolic and known to be not
literally true, there is a great deal of disgrace attached to
being incapacitated, however briefly, and a general distrust
of medicine. As other sayings have illustrated, Klingons
value being in control, so having the need for medical
intervention is a sign not only of physical weakness but of
spiritual weakness. As the Klingon Kras put it when
describing the Klingon attitude about ill health to the
Capellans, "The sick should die. Only the strong should
live."
     As a member of Starfleet, Worf had voiced these and
similar platitudes from time to time. He has added rea-
son to adhere to this virtue: A medical officer can override
even a commanding officer's orders and is therefore always
a potential threat to one's ability to maintain control. [[p.41]]

Pleasure is nonessential.

{'utbe' bel.}

This Klingon truism is heard, in one form or another, again
and again and probably dates back to ancient times, when
warfare was carried out not in space vessels, but on fields
where only the most indispensable supplies could be car-
ried. Not only are consideration such as comfort, ease,
and enjoyment not part of the Klingon way of thinking, to
find them even desirable might be considered a sign of
weakness. Thus, Worf explained to Riker, "I am not con-
cerned with pleasure.... I am a warrior." The Klingon [[....:=...]]
emissary K'Ehleyr, who was half-human and half-Klingon
and therefore tended to view much of Klingon culture from
a unique perspective, noted that "Klingons are not sup-
posed to mind hardship."
     On the other hand, it is assumed that non-Klingons do
not share this sentiment. When showing Picard and Data
their slablike beds on his ship, Klingon Captain K'Vada
said, "You'll sleep Klingon style. We don't soften our bod-
ies by putting down a pad." Though Klingon ships certain-
ly could be designed to include various amenities, there is
never any thought given to doing so. As Klingon Captain
Koloth told Captain Kirk, "We do not equip our ships with
... nonessentials."

A warrior does not complain about
physical discomfort.

{loQ 'oy'DI' SuvwI' bepbe'.}

The Social stigma attached to incapacitation extends to
perception: Whatever one's health, one does not want to be
known as anything less than fully vigorous. The Federation
Standard word "discomfort" somewhat distorts the meaning
of the Klingon, which refers to a warrior "aching slightly."

<The Next Generation: Clues>


Klingons never bluff.

{not toj tlhInganpu'.}

Masked by its simplicity, this is actually a very clever
Klingon epigram. If Klingons do indeed never resort to
deception, the statement (more literally, "Klingons never
deceive") expresses the truth. If, on the other hand,
Klingons do mislead, then the statement is an example of
that practice in action. Worf had made use of this phrase
quite appropriately during games of poker.

<The Next Generation: The Emissary> [[p.47]]


Adhere to virtue honorably.

{batlh ghob yIpab.}

This maxim, one of several about virtue itself, illustrates
the importance of virtue in Klingon society. Not only
should one be virtuous ("adhere to virtue"), that is, behave
in a way Klingons consider morally righteous, one should
take care to honor and respect those values. In other words,
one should not merely endorse the values of the society,
one should fully embrace their spirit and meaning. The
Klingon verb in the expression, "{pab}," is here translated
"adhere," bit it is also used to mean "follow," in the sense
of following rules, suggesting perhaps that, though not offi-
cially laws, virtues should be followed as if they were.


Virtue is the reward.

{pop 'oH ghob'e'.}

The Klingon word "{pop}" ("reward") could refer to com-
pensation or a prize of some sort, but it also means "honor"
in the sense of recognition for a particular achievement or
set of achievements. This proverb does not mean "Virtue is
honor." The use of the word "{pop}" suggests that virtue is
the honor bestowed as a result of acting in a manner
respectful of society's values, not simply advocating them. [[p.48]]


One need not enjoy virtue.

{ghob tIvnISbe'lu'.}

Since, as noted earlier, Klingons find pleasure nonessen-
tial, it is not surprising to find virtue described as some-
thing that is not enjoyable. On the other hand, this apho-
rism does not say that virtue is never enjoyable, only that
it is not necessarily so. The Klingon construction
"{tInISbe'}" means "does not need to enjoy"; "{tIbe'nIS}"
would mean "needs to not enjoy," an utterly different con-
cept. Leading a virtuous life may well be enjoyable, but if
it is not, or if it is not always, it should still be done. [[p.49]]


There is always a chance.

{reH 'eb tu'lu'.}

After Starfleet arranged for war exercises in which
Commander Riker captained the eighty-year-old
<Hathaway>, Riker lamented that his ship was no match for
the <Enterprise>. Even if it was just a simulation, he felt there
was no way he could win. Wolf, believing that, as the
Klingons say, "There is always a chance," suggested that
what one lacks in physical power one makes up for with
guile.
     The common Klingon sendoff, "{Qapla',}" "success," is
another overt signal of this warrior spirit: success is always
possible.

<The Next Generation: Peak Performance> [[p.50]]

Capture all opportunities.

{Hoch 'ebmey tIjon.}

Worf passed this Klingon wisdom on to Picard when he
said, "We may only have one opportunity; we should seize
it." In Klingon, opportunities are captured, not taken; a
missed opportunity is said to have escaped.

Honor is more important than life.

{batlh potlh law' yIn potlh puS.}

Kurn, Worf's brother, said, "A Klingon's honor means more
to him than his life." Worf passed the belief on to his son,
Alexander: "A Klingon's honor is more important to him
that his life. A Klingon would gladly face the most horri-
ble punishment rather than bring shame or disgrace to his
family name."
     The degree to which this Klingon virtue is revered is
perhaps best illustrated by an action of Lieutenant
Commander Worf. The lieutenant command was unwill-
ing to join Gowron, leader of the High Council, in his inva-
sion of Cardassia in part because to do so would have
required him to renounce his oath of allegiance to Starfleet
and the Federation. Gowron told Worf that this rejection
carried serious consequences: Worf would be unwelcome
in the Klingon Empire, his brother would be removed from
the High Council, his family would lose its lands and titles.
"You will be left with nothing," Gowron said. Worf encap-
sulated the true nature of being a Klingon with his reply,
"Except my honor."

Kurn, wanted to join the rebellion against Gowron, who was
about to be installed as leader of the Klingon High
Council. Gowron refused to overturn Worf's discommenda-
tion, the penalty of banishment and public disgrace
accepted by the lieutenant commander after his unsuc-
cessful challenge to the charge that his father was a traitor.
Worf felt that Gowron was the only rightful leader of the
Klingons and told his brother to support Gowron. "We can/
not regain honor by acting dishonorably," he said. Later,
Kurn's intervention helped to turn away an attach on
Gowron by followers of the family of Duras. To reward
them, Gowron, now the leader of the Council, restored their
family honor.

<The Next Generation: Redemption> [[p.56]]


When you insult a Klingon's honor,
prepare for trouble.

{tlhIngan quv DatIchDI' Seng yIghuH.}

Klingon scientist Kurak was thinking of this aphorism
when she informed Dr. Crusher, "Insulting the honor of a
Klingon can be extremely dangerous."

<The Next Generation: Suspicions>


If you cannot fail, you cannot succeed.

{bIlujlaHbe'chugh bIQaplaHbe'.}

This maxim might also be translated as "If you cannot lose,
you cannot win." Worf told Riker, "If there is nothing to
lose---no sacrifice---there is nothing to gain."

<The Next Generation: Peak Performance> [[p.57]]


If you cannot be shamed, you
cannot be honored.

{bItuHlaHbe'chugh bIquvlaHbe'.}

Honor, it would appear, cannot exist in a vacuum. One
cannot experience the feeling associated with honor
unless one has the capacity to feel and understand the
utter lack of it.
     It is interesting to note how the Federation's percep-
tion of the Klingons has changed over the years. Initially,
only the Klingons' warlike nature was noted. Klingons
were viewed two-dimensionally and described as brutal
and ruthless. Little else of their nature was known or, for
the most part, cared about. Following the Khitomer peace
conference, relations between the Federation and the
Empire gradually improved. Fifty years later, Captain
Rachel Garrett, in command of the <U.S.S. Enterprise> NCC-
1701-C, would consider Klingons to be people, not objects
of derision, and would render aid to a Klingon outpost on
Narendra III, which was being attacked by Romulans. This
action helped greatly in solidifying the Federation-Klingon
alliance. Within the next twenty years, a Klingon, Worf,
would join Starfleet and serve aboard a Federation ship,
and a Starfleet officer, Picard, would actually participate
in the process to choose a new Klingon leader. Recent
events regarding the invasion of Cardassia notwithstand-
ing, the Klingon are now seen to have a complex, multi-
layered culture, in which not only combativeness and
aggressiveness are valued, but honor, loyalty, and virtue
play key roles. [[p.58]]

'angbe'bogh.}

This is an adage about Klingon behavior cited by K'mpec,
leader of the Klingon High Council, when he revealed to
Picard that he had been poisoned. Worf took it one step fur-
ther, assuming that, since no Klingon would behave in such
a dishonorable fashion, the assassination could not have
been carried out by a Klingon. "A Klingon would not use
poison," he stated. "The murder would have no honor."

Only an enemy without honor refuses to

{'ang'eghQo' quv Hutlhbogh jagh neH
ghobtaHvIS ghaH.}

As is often the case, people assume that the values of their
culture are shared by other cultures, whether or not this is
the reality. Thus, as this variation of the preceding maxim
suggests, it is considered dishonorable for anyone, not just
a Klingon, to battle covertly. It is probably because of this
belief that Klingons have never engage in wide-scale
guerrilla warfare.

{nIteb DujlIj yIchIj.}

Worf cited the first of these similar maxims to Counselor
Troi when she suggested that he talk about his feeling. As
with many Klingon sayings, it is framed in terms of con-
frontation. It literally means "A leader must fight alone." It
refers to a basic tenet of Klingon society, self-sufficiency. [[p.64]]

May you enemies run with fear.

{ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.}

As with common sayings on other languages, some Klingon
proverbs, particularly those which have taken on ritualistic
overtones, exhibit unusual grammatical forms. For
instance, the Federation Standard, "If it ain't broke, don't
fix it," exhibits nonstandard grammar, but it is still under-
stood by all and is almost always heard in this form.
Similarly, the commonly heard version of this Klingon
expression, as uttered by Kurn and cited above, is gram-
matically aberrant. If the expression were rendered in
everyday Klingon, it would be "{jaghmeylI' DaghIjjaj
qetjaj jaghmeylI'}" ("May you scare your enemies, may
your enemies run.").

<The Next Generation: Sins of the Father> [[p.66]]


For one mission, there is one leader.

{wa' Qu'vaD wa' DevwI' tu'lu'.}

Though phrased in what could be considered militaristic
terms ("{Qu'}," "mission," and "{DevwI'}," "leader"), this
proverb is also often applied figuratively. If "mission" is
interpreted to stand for the way one conducts one's life, the
overall meaning is "one must guide oneself." It is yet
another example of the Klingon virtue of self-sufficiency. [[p.67]]


A Klingon does not postpone a
matter of honor.

{batlh qelDI' tlhIngan, lumbe'.}

As several of these saying make clear, nothing is more
important to a Klingon than honor. When the Klingon offi-
cer Kulge questioned Gowron's leadership abilities,
Gowron interrupted a strategy-planning session to engage
him in a fight, eventually killing him, even though this
delayed necessary planning for an ongoing war. To an out-
sider, Gowron's priorities might seem skewed, but to a
Klingon, he acted properly. Even affairs of the Empire
must take a back seat to protecting one's honor.

This is an extremely common Klingon locution, often
uttered when the odds seem to favor an opponent. It does
not, however, represent a defeatist attitude. Quite the con-
trary, in a society in which warriors are so revered, to die
in battle in a noble aspiration. Kang, of course, spoke iron-
ically when, accepting the proposition that there was a

"It is a good day to live."

May you die well.

{batlh bIHeghjaj.}


To die well---that is, honorably, in battle---is the desire of
every Klingon. Captain Larg offered this proposition as a
toast to Kurn when they were drinking in a Klingon tavern,
celebrating their upcoming confrontation. Tough ene-
mies, they were, above all else, Klingons, and fortunate
ones at that, for soon they would engage in fierce combat.
     Any other sort of death, however, is a different matter.
When, due to an accident, Worf was unable to walk, he felt
his life was over. He believed that he would not be able to
participate in future battles and therefore would not die in
one. As a result, he chose to take his own life in a form of
ritual suicide. Tough he saw no alternative, he knew he
would not "die well." As he told Riker, "I do not welcome
death."


<The Next Generation: Redemption>

<The Next Generation: Ethics> [[p.72]]


If you are afraid to die, you
have already died.

{bIHeghvIpchugh bIHeghpu'.}


Worf was referring to death resulting form a battle when he
told a noncorporeal criminal life-form which had possessed
Data and tried to goad the Klingon into attacking him,
"I have no fear of death." One of the Klingons' most pow-
erful motivations when engaging in battle is the possibility
that they will die a glorious and honorable death in that
confrontation. To feel otherwise, to fear an honorable
death, is to resist a basic Klingon passion. Lacking this
spark, this reason to go on, is equivalent, in the Klingon
way of seeing things, to not living at all.


<The Next Generation: Power Play> [[p.73]]


Death is an experience best shared.

{Heghlu'DI' mobbe'lu'chugh
QaQpu' Hegh wanI'.}


One of the purposes of the Klingon Tea Ceremony, in which
two friends share poisoned tea as a test of bravery, is to
remind one of this truism. The ceremony, which is usually
observed in periods of relative calm, between wars, proba-
bly came about as a way to reinforce and celebrate certain
beliefs about warfare so central to Klingon culture. The
ceremony symbolically acknowledges the dignity of death
in battle, and it also pay tribute to warriors who battle
alongside one another.

enjoy eating poison.

{bIQapqu'meH tar DaSop 'e' DatIvnIS.}


This proverb suggests that the road to success is filled with
peril, intrigue, risk, double-dealing, and other challenges
to one's existence. To be truly successful, one must not only
deal with such hazards, one must revel in doing so.
Klingons have always considered it truly invigorating to
face danger. As Commander Kruge said to Captain Kirk
while the Genesis planet on which they were stranded was
quickly falling apart, "Exhilarating, isn't it?"

<Star Trek III: The Search for Spock> [[p.74]]


To die defending his ship is the
hope of every Klingon.

{DujDaj HubtaHvIS Hegh
'e' tul Hoch tlhIngan.}


To die in the line of duty is the
hope of every Klingon.

{Qu'Daj ta'taHvIS Hegh 
'e' tul Hoch tlhIngan.}


To die while serving the Empire is the
hope of every Klingon.

{wo' toy'taHvIS Hegh 'e' tul Hoch tlhIngan.}


Klingons are very concerned about their manner of death,
so there are a number of relevant---and similar---sayings.
Running through all of them is the idea that one's death
should be honorable and purposeful. Clearly this applies to
warriors, but since not everyone can be a warrior, Klingons
also value other forms of duty and service to the Empire.
Worf, then, reacted appropriately when, upon learning that
someone had died in his sleep, remarked, "What a terrible
way to go." This applies not only to Klingons, but to their
friends. Thinking that Geordi La Forge had died, Worf told [[p.75]]

A Klingon warrior is always
prepared to fight.

{reH Suvrup tlhIngan SuvwI'.}


I Klingon it is not customary to say "to be prepared" with-
out saying what one is prepared to do. There are, conse-
quently, several version of this proverb, the general mean-
ing of which is  "A Klingon warrior is always prepared." As
called for by the situation, a specific activity is plugged in.
Kang, for example, said, "A Klingon warrior is always pre-
pared to die" ("{reH Heghrup tlhIngan SuvwI'}") It is
even acceptable to use this proverb for less weighty mat-
ters, such as to eat and to drink. Not unexpectedly, using it
to refer to an activity not prized by Klingons, such as to
flee, to surrender, or to apologize, is particularly insulting.

Never leave without your bat'telh.

{bImejDI' reH betleHlIj yItlhap.}


The bat'telh ("{betleH}"), sometimes called the "sword of
honor," is probably the most Klingon of weapons. The orig-
inal bat'leth was forged by Kahless the Unforgettable him-
self and, as a result, the weapon has rich cultural signifi-
cance, not just sharp edges. This traditional admonition
has a dual interpretation: As you venture out, always be
prepared, and always maintain your identity as a Klingon.

[[Transcriber's Note: There are two Federation Standard spellings of {betleH},
and they're both ("bat'telh" and "bat'leth") used above.]] [[p.80]]


No Klingon ever breaks his word.

{not lay'Ha' tlhIngan.}


Worf used this dictum when teaching his son, Alexander,
about Klingon ways. He also taught that a Klingon's "word
is his bond. Without it, he is nothing." Within the Klingon
Empire, there are no written treaties. Apparently, because
of this virtue of integrity, there is no need. This has caused
conflicts from time to time in dealing with the Federation,
which prefers documentation.


<The Next Generation: Cost of Living>

<The Next Generation: New Ground> [[p.81]]


Focus on but one target.

{wa' DoS neH yIbuS.}


Tough cast in warrior's terms, this dictum is really about
priorities of any kind. It suggests that one should concen-
trate all one's attention on the task at hand and not try to
do several things at once. Worf expresses the same convic-
tion when referring to poker: "Talk or play, not both."

You salute the stars.

{Hovmey Davan.}


This is an unusual, but not unique, saying because it refers
to a legend that must be known in order for the phrase to
be understood. Outside the Empire, the details of this par-
ticular legend are quite sketchy, but the story seems to
have something to do with a warrior who is about to be exe-
cuted and asks for permission to go off alone, unguarded,
in order to salute the stars a final time. Sometimes the war-
rior is said to have wanted to "say farewell" to the stars.
Saying farewell, of course, is an artifact of translation.
Under most circumstances, a Klingon would never literal-
ly say "farewell" or "good-bye" upon taking his leave; he
would simply walk away. If, however, he wanted to show
honor or respect, he may offer a salute, often verbalized as
"{Qapla'}" ("success"). The request was granted, since,
even in ancient times, it was known that a warrior keeps
his word. Thus, "You salute the stars" means "I trust you"
or "I know you will honor your word." [[p.84]]

A beard is a symbol of courage.

{toDuj 'oS rol.}


Though Klingons have a vast array of power weapons, the
purest form of combat is hand-to-hand. Fighting in such
close proximity to one another, a beard may be though of
by some as a disadvantage since one of the combatants may
grab onto the beard of the other and draw his closer. To
wear a beard, and long heir for that matter, shows that one
is both brave and confident---willing to give the opponent
the upper hand, and secure that one's own skills are
superior.

Lieutenant Commander Worf has modified this old Klingon
expression to a form more suitable for the <Enterprise:> "Less
talk, more synthehol." Though he would prefer a true war-
rior's drink, while on a Federation starship he must make
do with the available fare.


<The Next Generation: Transfigurations> [[p.88]]


A warrior fights to the death.

{wej Heghchugh vay', SuvtaH SuvwI'.}


A somewhat more literal translation of this expression is "If
someone has not yet died, a warrior keeps on fighting."
That is, it does not matter who dies, but the fight is not over
until one of the combatants is killed. As will be seen in a
number of sayings cited later on, Klingons attach little if
any value to prisoners. Only those lacking virtue would
allow themselves to be taken prisoner in the first place. A
true warrior and, by extrapolation, an opponent worthy of a
true warrior would rather die.


<The Next Generation: Birthright> [[p.89]]


Klingons do not surrender.

{jeghbe' tlhInganpu'.}


In order to stop the torturing of Ensign Chekov by the
Klingons, James Kirk agreed to let Kang take over the
<Enterprise>. Chekov protested, referring to the Klingons as
animals, but Commander Kang thought the epithet was
misplaced. "Animals. Your captain crawls like one," he
said. "A Klingon would never have surrendered."
     Because of this Klingon trait, Klingon emissary
K'Ehleyr argued against disabling a Klingon ship whose
crew was unaware of the peace treaty between the
Federation and the Empire. If the ship were merely dis-
abled, she said, the ship's captain would "destroy it him-
self." Worf concurred by simply quoting the maxim:
"Klingon do not surrender."
     I Klingon, the for word for "surrender," "{jegh}," also can
be translated as "give up," in the sense of abandoning a
project. Thus, the saying also means that Klingons are per-
sistent or even obstinate. As Worf put it, "Klingons do not
give up easily."

This maxim also appears in other guises, depending on
what it is a Klingon does not run from. The general mean-
ing of all of them is that Klingons do not flee; they do not
abdicate their responsibilities or avoid the consequences
of their actions. For example, when Worf decided to chal-
lenge the charge of treason leveled against his father, he
knew that he would have to accept the penalty---death---if
unsuccessful. A Klingon does not run from a judgment
against him.

As noted earlier, Klingons are not fond of the notion of
prisoners. After Admiral Kirk killed Klingon Commander
Kruge and took over his bird-of-prey, Maltz, the sole sur-
viving Klingon crew member of that ship, requested that he
be killed rather than be taken prisoner. To Maltz's chagrin,
Kirk refused to do so. Worf is also aware of the attitude. "A
Klingon would rather die than be taken prisoner," he
responded when the Yridian Jaglom Shrek suggested that
Mogh, Worf's father, might have been captured and be still
living.

Better to die on our feet than

More literally, this is "Dying while standing is preferable to

bit aberrant; one would expect "{QamtaHvIS}" ("while
continuing to stand") and "{tortaHvIS}" (while continuing
to kneel"). I proverbs, however, grammatical shortcuts are

considered somewhat incomplete. One would expect "<It is>

     Klingon Chancellor Azetbur said she believed that the
Empire was on the verge of becoming "obsolete." Because
the destruction of the moon Praxis had devastated the main
energy production facility for the Empire. She argued that
the Klingon had no choice but to engage in peace talks
with the Federation. Her military advisor, Brigadier Kerla,
disagreed, citing this maxim to express his opinion.

Cowards take hostages. Klingons do not.

{vubpu' jon nuchpu'. jonbe' tlhInganpu'.}


This adage, quoted by Worf to <Enterprise> security chief
Tasha Yar, explicitly expresses the Klingon idea that taking
a hostage is not a courageous act. Nevertheless, under cer-
tain circumstances, Klingons do take prisoners. When
Commander Kang believed Kirk had destroyed his ship, he
claimed the <Enterprise> and told Kirk and his crew, "You are
now prisoners of the Klingon Empire against which you've
committed a wanton act of war." He even threatened to
"kill one hundred hostages at the first sign of treachery."
This was a pragmatic move on Kang's part, of course, since
he needed the cooperation---coerced or otherwise---of Kirk
to gain control of the starship.
     Similarly, Commander Kruge seemed to violate the
norm when he and his men came across a group of
Federation citizens---Lieutenant Saavik, David Marcus,
and a young Spock---on the Genesis planet and seized
them. His intention was to interrogate them and learn
about the Genesis torpedo, not to hold them as hostages.
Thus, when Kirk unexpectedly showed up, it was happen-
stance, not cowardice, that put Kruge in the position of
being able to take advantage of the situation. He used the
three as bargaining chips to negotiate with Kirk for what he
really wanted. In Kruge's mind, he had not run afoul of the
Klingon virtue.

No one survived Khitomer.

{QI'tomerDaq Heghpu' Hoch.}


This adage refers to an event and states its meaning by way
of reference rather than directly. A Klingon outpost on the
planet Khitomer was attacked by Romulans, who presum-
ably killed everyone there except the young Worf and his
nursemaid, Kahlest, who were rescued by Starfleet. When,
from time to time, a rumor surfaced that there were other
survivors, the rumor was always quashed. If there were sur-
vivors, the thinking went, they must have been captured,
which would mean there are Klingons somewhere being
held prisoner. This is intolerable, since both they and their
families would be dishonored, and it is summarily dis-
missed as an impossibility. The phrase, then, is used to
mean that an unacceptable situation is being rejected or
denied outright. The literal translation of the Klingon is a
little more blunt: "Everyone died at Khitomer."

The kut'luch ("{qutluch}") is a hand-held blade described

terms used referring to a murderer, a persona not unknown
to Klingons, the proverb has a more general application.
Only if one plies his trade or practices his art with some
frequency will he remain at the peak of his skills.
     The use of the kut'luch by assassins does not mean the
weapon is used by no one else, nor does it mean that assas-
sins never use other weapons. The way the weapon is used
for ritual is utterly obscure, but the fact that the kut'luch
has taken on a special status may explain why it has come
to stand symbolically for assassination, perhaps in a man-
ner that parallels the connection of "cloak and dagger"
with intrigue and espionage on Earth. [[p.104]]

suggests is not that fear is not a factor, but rather that it is
something to be understood and acted upon, not brushed
aside. Worf tried to explain this to Wesley Crusher suing
this Klingon adage. On another occasion, Worf, suffering
from severe sleep deprivation, said to Counselor Troi, "I
am no longer a warrior. I am no longer strong. I feel fear."
It was not the fear that caused him concern. It was his lack
of ability to deal with it.

when battle is not productive. Kang quoted this proverb to
the alien life form that caused his band of Klingon and
Kirk's crew to engage in incessant bloodshed, informing
the being that it had created circumstances that actually
made combat inappropriate.
     Significantly, the agreement by Kang and Kirk to stop
fighting marked the first time that Klingons and humans
cooperated of their own accord, foreshadowing the alliance
between the Empire and the Federation years later. An
earlier ban on hostilities between the two parties had been

While Commander Riker was serving aboard the Klingon
cruiser <Pagh> in as officer exchange program, a bacteria
was discovered eating away the ship's hull. The Klingons
blamed the <Enterprise> for this and resolved to destroy the
Federation ship in retaliation. In the meantime, the
<Enterprise> was searching for the <Pagh> in order to help rid
the Klingon ship of the bacteria. Assuming, correctly, that
the <Pagh> was cloaked in readiness for an attack, the
<Enterprise> raised its shields, which the Klingons took as an
act of aggression. Riker said that this was a precautionary
measure, that the <Enterprise> would not fire first. Kargan,
the <Pagh>'s captain, alluded to this proverb, saying, "Then
they are fools, for we will."
     It is most likely that this value applies only in situa-
tions of potential battle. A Klingon would found no honor in
attacking an unarmed vessel without provocation.

"Ah, sentimentality, mercy---the emotions of peace. Your
weakness, Captain Kirk." It is noteworthy that the con-
junction in the Klingon phrase is "{ghap}" ("either/or"), not
"{joq}" ("and/or"). This implies that one must choose

Keep holding the hammer!

As Data told Picard, the hammer is a symbol of power to
Klingons. Thus, this exhortation is really saying to main-
tain power once it is achieved. The origin of the hammer's
allegorical meaning is somewhat obscure, but it seems to
have something to do with the way hammers were used to
fashion weapons in ancient times. If one had a hammer,
one could make one's own weapon and be self-sufficient.
If one did not have a hammer, however, one was, at least to
some degree, at the mercy of others.

Revenge is the best revenge.

In Klingon society revenge is not merely a desirable
response to an affront; it is, at least under some circum-
stances, a legal right called the Right of Vengeance
({bortaS DIb}). When Worf refused to kill Toral, the son of
Duras, as revenge for the Duras family's role in dishonor-
ing Worf's father, Kurn did not understand his brother's
decision, since taking revenge is "the Klingon way." Kor, a
highly honored Klingon captain, was equally incredulous:
"A Klingon who denies himself the Right of Vengeance is
no Klingon at all."

After the Klingon Kozak died in Quark's bar on space sta-

On the other hand, a death resulting from a battle in hon-
orable and, as the adage states, "requires no vengeance."
Though Kozak actually died when he fell on his own knife,
to save himself Quark lies and says he killed Kozak in "a
brave and valiant battle." In fact, the Klingon, D'Ghor, was
not Kozak's brother at all but a member of a rival house.
Their family stood to gain control over Kozak's property as
long as there were no unusual circumstances surrounding
Kozak's death, such as its being accidental. Citing this [[its:=it]]

Revenge is a dish which is best served cold.

This old Klingon proverb is known beyond the Empire. For
example, it was cited by Khan Noonien Singh, a genetical-

cally in the late twentieth century. He had escaped in a
sleeper ship and remained in suspended animation until
awakened in the twenty-third century when he was rescued
by the <U.S.S. Enterprise> NCC-1701. Khan must have
learned of this expression when he was studying material
in Federation data banks. Though, as far as is known, Khan
never had any direct contact with Klingons, he shared at
least one attitude with them: a need for revenge when
wronged. Khan died while trying to take revenge on James
T. Kirk, whom he felt had abandoned him on what became
an uninhabitable planet.

If winning is not important,
then why keep score?

{potlhbe'chugh yay qatIh pe''eghlu'?} [[qatIh:=qatlh]]

This adage is phrased as a rhetorical question, and Worf
used it that way after Riker told him that the main reason
to play a game of parrises squares is to have fun. It is pos-
sible that this expression is relatively new, one that arose
after contact with humans who would be heard saying such
things as, "Wining isn't everything" or "It's not whether
you win or lose, it's how you play the game." From the
Klingon point of view, such a position is, at the very least,
odd. Since humans persist in this way of looking at things,
however, Worf may have decided to simply opt out of situ-
ations where this attitude presents itself. Thus, when invit-
ed by Dr. Julian Bashir and Chief Miles O'Brien to join
them in a game of darts, the Klingon replied, "I do not play
games." After O'Brien described the activity as target
practice, however, the lieutenant commander agreed to
participate.
     The Klingon way to say "keep score" is "{pe''egh,}" lit-
erally, "cut oneself." It comes form an old Klingon habit of
keeping track of accomplishments by making small cuts on
one's skin, usually on the face, as a tally. Perhaps coinci-
dentally, Klingons' faces are often similarly scratched fol-
lowing romantic encounters.

The execution of but one warrior
brings shame to all.

{wa' SuvwI' muHlu'DI', tuHchoH

Worf recognized that Klingon renegades Korris an Konmel
must be punished, but because they were Klingons, he felt
they should be allowed to "meet death on their feet with a
weapon in their hands, not tied and helpless." To be exe-
cuted as a prisoner is to die dishonorably, and this dishon-
or reflects on Klingons in general. K'nera, who had come to
take the rebels back to the Klingon Homeworld, agreed.
"When one of us dies that way," he said, alluding to the
well-known Klingon adage, "it diminishes us all." To the
Klingon way of thinking, being held captive is not only a
disgrace, the very notion of a Klingon prisoner is an oxy-
moron.

He doesn't eat gagh!

{qagh Sopbe'!}


Everyone loves gagh, so if one is not eating it, something
must be wrong. This expression is used to mean that there
is something wrong with someone or that someone is acting
suspiciously. It is also a way to refer to somebody as a
coward.
     For Klingons, among whom cursing is a highly devel-
oped art form, this is a rather mild dismissive remark, not
a strong insult. As this expression demonstrates, even
though Klingon culture in known for its directness, it is
also capable of expressing ideas subtly. [[p.138]]

Klingon Commander Korris, who strongly opposed the

up Starfleet and join with him to live the life of a "true"

the words 'duty,' 'honor,' 'loyalty,' without which a warrior
is nothing?"

When Captain Klag said this to William Riker, he was
speaking literally, actually talking about the Klingon deli-
cacy gagh, or serpent worms. The same expression, howev-
er, is often sued figuratively to mean that a fight is always
better when there is a worthy adversary, or that one should
always want to face real challenges.


<The Next Generation: A Matter of Honor> [[p.142]]


{butlh ghajbogh nuv'e' yIHo'.}

Admire the person with dirt under his fingernails.

The Klingon word "{butlh}" ("dirt under fingernails") can be
taken literally, but in this expression it means something
like "effrontery, impudence, brazenness." The origin of this
usage of the term is obscure, but it may be connected to the
notion that one not having "{butlh}" is leading a soft, com-
fortable, not very Klingonlike life. To say to someone
"{butlh DaHutlh.}" ("You lack dirt under your fingernails")
is highly insulting. It means that the person is lacking in a
certain kind of Klingon spirit. In Federation Standard, an
approximate equivalent is gall. Indeed, Worf said to Kevin
Uxbridge, "Your attempt to hold the away team at bay with
a nonfunctioning weapon was an act of unmitigated gall...
I admire gall." Had Worf said that Uxbridge's action was
"an act of unmitigated dirt under the fingernails," he would
have been misunderstood, at the very least. The Klingon
way to say, "you lack gall" is "{HuH DaHutlh.}" This is lit-
erally "You lack bile," and a Klingon would probably only
understand it biologically.

Kell, a Klingon working as a Romulan operative, tried to
appeal to Worf's Klingon nature when he praised Worf for
killing Duras. Worf protested that he did so for personal,
not political, reasons. Kell took his cue from this Klingon
adage. "Who cares for motives?" he said. "You acted that
day as a true Klingon."

When a warrior dies, his spirit escapes.

{HeghDI' SuvwI' nargh SuvwI' qa'.}


When a Klingon dies, it is thought that his spirit leaves his
body and goes to join the spirit of other dead Klingons.
This is marked in the Klingon Death Ritual when the sur-
viving comrades howl---a warning to the dead that a war-
rior's spirit is on its way. The body, once the spirit has left
it, is considered a worthless shell and is discarded uncer-
emoniously. Exactly what Klingons think the spirit is doing
when it leaves the body is a little unclear. The verb
"{nargh,}" found in the saying cited above, means
"escape," but the same word, or a phonetically identical
one, means "appear." Thus, perhaps the Klingons are say-
ing that when a warrior dies, his spirit appears, whereas
prior to death it was hidden or disguised by the body.
Another interpretation is that the spirit was held prisoner
by the body. Worf told Jeremy, whose mother had been
killed, "In my tradition, we do not grieve the loss of the
body. We celebrate the releasing of the spirit."

If the warrior's spirit has not escaped, the

{narghbe'chugh SuvwI' qa' taH may'.}


This saying, which also contains the word {nargh} discussed
on page 145, is used to caution the listener not to draw con-
clusions too soon. Its import resembles several twentieth- [[twentieth-:=twentieth]]
century Earth expressions beginning "It's not over until.."
     After being paralyzed from the waist down as the result
of an accident, Worf at first felt his life had ended and
decided to commit ritual suicide ("{Heghbat}"). Later, he
had a change of heart. Though this may have been because,
as William Riker suggested, Worf did not want his son,
Alexander, to participate in his father's death as would be
required by the ritual, it may also have been because Worf
remembered the teachings of this proverb. The warrior
spirit was still within him; he would continue the battle and
try a new form of therapy. [[p.148]]


Curse well!

{pe'vIl mu'qaDmey tIbach.}


Cursing or swearing, is considered a fine art among
Klingons. One who curses well is the recipient of a great
deal of respect; one  who does not curse well may not be
worthy enough to be called Klingon. This it was a compli-
ment when Klingon Governor Vagh said, "You swear well,
Picard. You must have Klingon blood in your veins." The
commonly heard sendoff "Curse well!"---roughly compara-
ble in usage to the Federation Standard "Good luck!"---lit-
erally means, "Shoot curses forcefully!" Curses are consid-
ered a weapon of a sort which must be propelled to their
targets.

<The Next Generation: The Mind's Eye> [[p.149]]


Conquer what you desire.

{vay' DaneHbogh yIchargh.}

The Klingon habit of "taking what we need," as Mara,
Commander Kang's wife, put it, is a very basic element of
the Klingon approach to life. Though she was speaking of
food, land, and the like, the attitude is more pervasive.
Worf referred to it when speaking of male-female relation-
ships, telling Data, "Klingons do not pursue relationships.
They conquer that which they desire."
     Quark, the Ferengi barkeep on space station Deep
Space 9, has had personal experience with the practical
application of this Klingon attitude. Because he killed the
Klingon Kozak, even though accidentally, Klingon custom
allowed him to assume Kozak's position as leader of a fam-
ily (or house) and to take Kozak's widow, Grilka. To main-
tain her position, and, since there was no male heir, to pre-
vent her holdings from falling into others' hands, Grilka
followed the advice of this Klingon adage: She conquered
Quark. In a ceremony almost totally lacking in pomp, each
made a short vow, (Quark's made under duress.) Grilka
kissed him, and they were married.

tle: "You and I will fight battles others can only dream of.
Our time for glory is here. This is not the time to worry
about stabilizers. It is a time to celebrate, for tomorrow we
may die." This ancient Klingon saying is unrelated to a
similar expression heard on Earth, "Eat, drink and be
merry, for tomorrow we may die." The Klingon locution
speaks of celebrating one's own impending, presumably
honorable and glorious, death. The Terran version has
come to mean "Enjoy yourself now; it may be your last
chance."

The bonds within a family, or house, are extremely strong
in Klingon culture, as illustrated by these two maxims.
Though the second is phrased in terms of male family
members only, and a time frame of three generations is
mentioned, this represents, so to speak, only the spirit of
the law. In fact, when an individual is dishonored, the next
several generations of his entire family are similarly dis-
honored, the period of time apparently depending on the
circumstances of the initial offense or misfortune. When
dishonored, members of the family may forfeit property as
well as any position in the government. The greatest loss is
the ability to walk proudly among other Klingons.

After de-evolving to a lizardlike state because a synthetic
T-cell had invaded the DNA of the <Enterprise> crew, Worf
pursued Deanna Troi. Captain Picard and Lieutenant
Commander Data decided to reproduce Troi's pheromones
and draw Worf away from her by spreading them around
the ship. This would work, Picard reasoned, because of a
notable fact about Klingons' genetic makeup. "Klingons
have a highly developed sense of smell," he pointed out.
     It is not surprising, then, that the sense of smell should
have worked its way into the Klingon body of wise sayings.
In teaching Toq, a young Klingon, about hunting, Worf
used the phrase cited here literally, but it is often used fig-
uratively, meaning something like "Learn from your expe-
riences."

scent that first speaks of love."

This admonishment against nonutilitarian killing was

because the Klingon Empire has limited resources, none of
which can be wasted. As Mara, Commander Kang's wife,
explained, "There are poor planets in the Klingon system."

the ability to maintain control over one's own actions.

Kor harked back to this expression when he said, referring

smile to much." To a Klingon, a smile signals not only
contentment, satisfaction, a good humor, but also com-
placency, the feeling that all is well. This would imply
there is no reason to do anything, no need to take action.
For Klingons, who always feel the need to act, someone
who seems to lack this need is either hiding something or
is simply bizarre. In either case, such a person is likely to
behave in an unreliable fashion.

Your father is a part of you always.

{reH DuSIgh vavlI'.}


Worf explained to Data that learning about your father
"tells you about yourself." Among Klingons, a son is known
by the deeds of his father. The importance of one's father is
demonstrated in the Klingon practice of using one's father's
name in identifying oneself. Worf, for example, would say,
"I am Worf, son of Mogh." Under some circumstances, one
might ever refer to him simply as "Son of Mogh" and not
say "Worf" at all.

If you sleep with targs, you'll
wake up with glob flies.

{bIQongtaHvIS nItlhejchugh targhmey bIvemDI'
nItlhej ghIlab ghewmey.}


The targ, a furry Klingon animal that more or less resem-
bles a Terran pig, is often kept as a pet. Indeed, Lieutenant
Commander Worf had one when he was young. It is also a
source of food, and heart of targ is a traditional Klingon
dish. The tiny Klingon glob flies typically swarm about
targs, undoubtedly making them that much more appeal-
ing. Pets, however, are for amusement; they are not associ-
ated with serious endeavors.
     For a Klingon, sleeping is not only a time for revital-
ization of the body, it is also a time for spiritual or psycho-
logical renewal, with dreams playing an important role.
Thus, the idea of sleeping with targs---or, as a more literal
translation of the proverb might put it, being accompanied
by targs while sleeping---suggests an association with triv-
ial rather than weighty matters. The result is waking up
with, perhaps being taken over by, glob flies, or insignifi-
cant thoughts. The message, then, is to maintain focus on
that which is meaningful. [[p.174]]

the traditional Klingon manner, the {Heghbat}. He asked
Riker to help him and hand him the knife, but Riker point-
ed out that, following tradition, that role belonged to Worf's
son, Alexander. After Worf objected that Alexander was
only a child, Riker argued that Alexander was old enough
since, as the proverb says, he could hold a blade. Worf

hand and their veneration of honor on the other. They also
show that Klingon and human characteristics are not total-

Earth saying "Might makes right." The third Klingon
maxim, used by Gowron, says that victors (actually, "con-
querors") "record" ("{qon}") history. It does not matter

A ship cloaks in order to attack.

{HIvmeH Duj So'lu'.}


This phrase is used both literally and figuratively. General
Koord said, "If my people are cloaked, then they intend to
strike," paraphrasing the literal meaning of the expression.
Figuratively, it can also refer to any situation where the
observable facts lead to an obvious conclusion.
     Because of the great amount of power required to
remain cloaked, Klingon ships must decloak before actual-
ly firing any weapons. Thus, even though they may
approach an enemy undetected, they strike secure in the
knowledge that the adversary knows the identity of the
attacker. This upholds the Klingon virtue, cited earlier,
that the only honorable way to do battle is to show one's
face. Klingon technology has long been advanced enough
to create a cloaking device that does not have to be deacti-
vated before firing, but Klingon morality discourages pur-
suing this option. The one time a ship was equipped with
such a device, a conspiracy of Klingons and others, acting
most dishonorably, used it to assassinate Klingon
Chancellor Gorkon.

If you want to eat pipius claw, you'll
have to break a few pipiuses.

{pIpyuS pach DaSop DaneHchugh

Pipius claw is a traditional Klingon dish. As with Klingon
food in general, it is not cooked, but neither is live or
just-killed pipius simply thrown in front of the diner. The
details of preparing pipius claw are not well understood, as
Klingon chefs are notoriously protective of their recipes. It
is believed that the pipius is torn apart and the various
pieces are soaked in (or perhaps basted with) some kind of
fluid of animal origin that adds flavor and chemically alters
the texture of the pipius.
     This proverb, however, is really not about food. It sup-
ports the Klingon virtues of conquering that which is
desired and taking of action---breaking a few pipiuses.
Indeed, on occasion, a modified version of the second part
of this expression is used as a command to tell someone,
often a child, to get started on or to devote more effort to a
project: "{pIpyuS yIghor!}" ("Break a pipius!") [[p.186]]


Trust, but locate the doors.

{yIvoq 'ach lojmItmey yISam.}


Trust, but verify.

{yIvoq 'ach yI'ol.}


These two adages offer the same advice: Even with those
who appear to be honorable, ethical, and deserving of trust,
one must always be careful. In the first expression, the
Klingon word for "door," "{lojmIt,}" could equally well be
translated "gate." It is used here to stand for any form of
entrance or, more important, exit. The general idea is to
have an escape route, a way out, or a backup plan should
the trust be misplaced. Accordingly, a Klingon is general-
ly apprehensive  when someone says of a commitment or a
plan, "{ngaQ lojmIt}" ("The door is locked"). The phrase
"{ngaQ lojmIt}" is also sometimes heard in reference to a
situation  with an inevitable, unavoidable outcome.
     The origin of the second proverb is unknown, but it
seems to be related to an ancient political movement
known as {ghIlaSnoS,} whose meaning has also been lost to

cost---a gift---something is surely amiss.
     Like the Klingons, the entrepreneurial Ferengi have a
great many wise sayings, an important subset of which is
known as the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition. The First Rule
of Acquisition is "Once you have their money, you never
give it back." Thus, Klingon thinking goes, if a Ferengi
does return money, he is acting most suspiciously.
     Both of these Klingon maxims embody the same gen-
eral belief: Those who violate the rules of their own cul-
ture and do not observe their own virtues are acting dis-
honorably and are not to be trusted. [[p.190]]


He can sell ice on Rura Penthe.

{rura' pente'Daq chuch ngevlaH ghaH.}


Rura Penthe is a frozen asteroid used by the Klingons as a
penal colony for enemies of the Empire. The expression is
descriptive of somebody who can do most anything, even
used adverse conditions.
     Klingons look down on prisoners as having behaved
dishonorably. If they had acted honorably, they would
never have been captured in the first place. Although
Klingon warriors fight to the death rather than take prison-
ers, there is a Klingon system of jurisprudence, and those
who are found to have violated the rules of society are often
punished by being forced to do particularly strenuous or
distasteful work. Having such a system is actually seen as
beneficial for Klingon society, since it provides a ready
source of necessary labor. The prisoners on Rura Penthe,
for example, mine dilithium, required for warp propulsion
systems. Significantly, the penal colony houses no Klingon
prisoners. A Klingon would never allow himself to be taken
prisoner, not even by his own government. [[p.191]]


Don't just aim; hit the target!

{yIQeqQo' neH. DoS yIqIp!}


This is another adage couched in the vocabulary or battle
that actually has wider application. Klingons hold that
there is no value in setting goals unless one achieves them.
This attitude complements the belief, noted earlier (see
page 135), that playing a game just for fun is an outlandish
notion. [[p.192]]

If a warrior does not fight,
he does not breathe.

{Suvbe'chugh SuvwI' tlhuHbe' SuvwI'.}


Worf showed awareness of this aphorism when he
explained to those in charge of space station Deep Space 9
that the accuracy of the Klingons' information that the
Dominion was responsible for an uprising on the
Cardassian homeworld was irrelevant. The Klingons were
using it merely as a justification to go into battle. "There
are many Klingons who say we have been at peace too
long," he said. "Klingons are warriors, and warriors fight."
     Perhaps Klingon General Chang was thinking of this
expression as well when he told Kirk, "We need breathing
room." Chang opposed the impending negotiations
between the Empire and the Federation precisely because
of the space it would bring.

Hear the warrior cry out!

{jach SuvwI' 'e' yIQoy!}


Gowron referred to this well-known cry when he said to
Worf, "Do you tremble and quake with fear at the approach
of combat, hoping to <talk> your way out of a fight like a
Human? Or do you hear the cry of the warrior calling you [[Human:=human]]
to battle, calling you to glory, like a Klingon? Are you one
of us?" Worf later told Picard, "I <do> hear the cry of the war-
rior."
     This exhortation resembles one cited earlier, "Listen to
the voice of your blood" (see page 31). The two make the
same point, but from different perspectives. To heed the
cry of the warrior is to follow the dictates of the society; to
listen to the voice of one's blood is to adhere to one's true
nature. For Klingons, of course, both lead to the same
result: living the life of a warrior.

<The Next Generation: Redemption> [[p.196]]


Anger excites.

{SeymoH QeH.}


For Klingons, anger is definitely not a negative emotion.
On the contrary, it can trigger acts of honor, energize bat-
tles, or prompt one to achieve one's goals. It provides moti-
vation for further action and, since taking action is central
to a Klingon's well-being, the overall effect is one of stim-
ulation, elation, and excitement. One's outrage should not
lead to recklessness, however, for careless action will inter-
fere with one's ultimate success.
     Federation diplomat Curzon Dax knew how Klingon
anger could be channeled into action. On the first day of
negotiations in the Korvat Colony, he walked out on a
speech being delivered by Kang. Curzon knew that he had
to get Kang very angry in order to create a bond between
the Klingon and himself, and thereby ensure the success of
his mission. [[p.197]]


You pay attention to your Fek'lhr and
I will pay attention to mine.

{veqlarghlI' yIbuS 'ej veqlarghwI' vIbuS.}


Fek'lhr is a mythical beast guarding Gre'thor, the place
where the spirits of the dishonored dead go. Not really a
devil (Kang once said that Klingons have no devil), it is
still a being to be reckoned with. The phrase means that
each individual has his own individual concerns, but it
also is a warning to be aware of that part of each individ-
ual's being---the beast within, perhaps---that may entice
one to stray onto a path leading to dishonor. [[p.198]]

Care about your students.

{ghojwI'pu'lI' tISaH.}


This bit of advice is actually---and probably intentional-
ly---ambiguous. It can be interpreted to mean "care about
your student' progress and welfare," but it can also mean
"care about who your students are"---that is, impart knowl-
edge only to those whom you trust.
     To Klingons, knowledge and expertise are matters of
pride. This includes both the understanding of history, rit-
uals, and legends, and also the mastery of various practical
techniques, such as those needed to be a successful war-
rior. Education and drilling continue throughout a
Klingon's life. There are even some ritualized forms of
practice, such as the {moQbara',} a type of martial art, and
the {qa'vaQ,} a hoop-and-stick maneuver that hones the
skills of the hunt.
     Complementing the value placed on learning is an
emphasis on teaching, the recognition that, in order to con-
tinue as a culture, it is important to pass on expertise to
future generations. At the same time, to grow as a culture,
it is acknowledged that teachers will learn from their stu-
dents, another reason to be sure that the student-teacher
relationship is one of mutual trust and respect. [[p.200]]


When an escaped prisoner looks for
a guard, he always finds one.

{'avwI' nejDI' narghta'bogh qama'
reH 'avwI' Sambej.}


This maxim carries a message similar to the Federation
dictum "Don't go looking for trouble." It suggests that if
one's being overcautious interferes with the task at hand,
the task is doomed. [[p.201]]


No enemy is boring.

{Dal pagh jagh.}


To be a warrior, one must have an opponent. Accordingly,
antagonists or enemies are not deemed undesirable. At the
very least, they are considered essential; in the case of
truly worthy adversaries, they are admired. Engaging in
battle with an enemy hones the warrior's skills and pushes
him to achieve victory. To have a rich and fulfilling life,
according to Klingon thinking, one must have an enemy. [[p.202]]

{DaHjaj SuvwI''e' jIH.}


I must show you my heart.

{tIqwIj Sa'angnIS.}


I travel the river of blood.

{'Iw bIQtIqDaq jIjaH.}


Upon reaching a certain age, the Age of Ascension, a
young Klingon undergoes a rite of passage symbolizing the
attainment of a certain spiritual level. After intoning the
three ancient and scared phrases recorded above, the ini-
tiate, while walking along a path lined by painstik-wield-
ing warriors, expresses his or her deepest feelings.

If you don't use the painstik, the child will
never celebrate his Age of Ascension.

{'oy'naQ Dalo'be'chugh
not nenghep lop puq.}


This is another way of saying that it is necessary to adhere
strictly to the particulars of any procedure in order to
achieve the desired goals. The proverb is phrased in terms
of the details of Rite of Ascension, during which, as noted,
warriors jab the Klingon youth with painstiks. It protocol is
not followed---it this case, if painstiks are not used---the
ceremony carries no import and the Age of Ascension has
not been celebrated. [[p.206]]


I am not a merry man.

{loD Quch jIHbe'.}


This is not a proverb or maxim of any kind, but rather an
offhand remark made by Worf in reference to his nature.
Though by itself of minor cultural importance, it nonethe-
less provides an example of Klingon introspection.

<The Next Generation: Qpid> [[p.207]]


Don't catch any bugs.

{ghewmey tISuqQo'.}


The Klingon guard at listening post Morska found this
advice funny. Klingon humor is difficult to understand, so
there is no ready explanation as to why he was so amused.

Destroying an empire to win a war is no
victory, and ending a battle to save
an empire is no defeat.

{noH QapmeH wo' Qaw'lu'chugh yay
chavbe'lu' 'ej wo' choqmeH may'
DoHlu'chugh lujbe'lu'.}


This is an ancient adage, originally voiced by Kahless him-
self.
     Interestingly, when the Federation first started learning
about Klingons, Kahless was considered to be no more
than an evil conqueror. He had formed an empire of, in
James Kirk's words, "conquered worlds." The Klingons,
Kirk felt, "take what they want by arms and force." As part
of their examination of the behavior of other life forms, the
Excalbians staged a conflict between the forces of
"good"---represented by Kirk, Spock, and the images of
Abraham Lincoln and the Vulcan philosopher Surak---and
those of "evil"---represented by, among others, the image
of Kahless. The Excalbians formed their replica of Kahless
on the basis of the Federation's concept of him.
Therefore, they described him in terms fitting an oppressor:
"the Klingon who set the pattern for his planet's tyrannies."
     In time, and as more was learned about Klingon histo-
ry and culture, the Federation's understanding of the role
of Kahless in Klingon history changed. It is now known
that Klingons consider him a great warrior who did indeed
conquer other worlds, but united the Empire by giving the
people the laws of honor which direct every Klingon's life.

{QaghmeylIj tIchID, yIyoH.}

<The Next Generation: Aquiel> [[p.213]]


Buy or die.

{bIje'be'chugh vaj bIHegh.}

This is a common saying among Klingon merchants, usual-
ly uttered when customers are in the store comparing prod-
ucts or sampling the available goods, but not purchasing
anything. Tellingly, there is no known Klingon word for
"browse," at least as applied to matters of commerce.
Klingon shops do not have windows, but doing the in-store
equivalent of window-shopping appears to be a bad idea. [[p.214]]

Noted Klingon language and cultural expert
Marc Okrand collects the wisdom of these great
warriors, taking proverbs and quotes from some
of its greatest thinkers and bringing Klingon
philosophy to lesser races across the galaxy.
